<h2>CHAPTER 1&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Uncle Sam</i>&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The gentleman who graced the gubernatorial armchair of our
state when this century was born happened to be an admirer of
classic lore and the sonorous names of antiquity.</p>
<p>It is owing to his weakness in bestowing pompous cognomens on
our embryo towns and villages that to-day names like Utica,
Syracuse, and Ithaca, instead of evoking visions of historic pomp
and circumstance, raise in the minds of most Americans the
picture of cocky little cities, rich only in trolley-cars and
Methodist meeting-houses.</p>
<p>When, however, this cultured governor, in his ardor,
christened one of the cities Troy, and the hill in its vicinity
Mount Ida, he little dreamed that a youth was living on its
slopes whose name was destined to become a household word the
world over, as the synonym for the proudest and wealthiest
republic yet known to history, a sobriquet that would be familiar
in the mouths of races to whose continents even the titles of
Jupiter or Mars had never penetrated.</p>
<p>A little before this century began, two boys with packs bound
on their stalwart shoulders walked from New York and established
a brickyard in the neighborhood of what is now Perry Street,
Troy.&nbsp; Ebenezer and Samuel Wilson soon became esteemed
citizens of the infant city, their kindliness and benevolence
winning for them the affection and respect of the community.</p>
<p>The younger brother, Samuel, was an especial favorite with the
children of the place, whose explorations into his deep pockets
were generally rewarded by the discovery of some simple
&ldquo;sweet&rdquo; or home-made toy.&nbsp; The slender youth
with the &ldquo;nutcracker&rdquo; face proving to be the merriest
of playfellows, in their love his little band of admirers gave
him the pet name of &ldquo;Uncle Sam,&rdquo; by which he quickly
became known, to the exclusion of his real name.&nbsp; This is
the kindly and humble origin of a title the mere speaking of
which to-day quickens the pulse and moistens the eyes of millions
of Americans with the same thrill that the dear old flag arouses
when we catch sight of it, especially an unexpected glimpse in
some foreign land.</p>
<p>With increasing wealth the brickyard of the Wilson brothers
was replaced by an extensive slaughtering business, in which more
than a hundred men were soon employed&mdash;a vast establishment
for that day, killing weekly some thousand head of cattle.&nbsp;
During the military operations of 1812 the brothers signed a
contract to furnish the troops at Greenbush with meat,
&ldquo;packed in full bound barrels of white oak&rdquo;; soon
after, Samuel was appointed Inspector of Provisions for the
army.</p>
<p>It is a curious coincidence that England also should have
taken an ex-army-contractor as her patron saint, for if we are to
believe tradition, St. George of Cappadocia filled that position
unsatisfactorily before he passed through martyrdom to
sainthood.</p>
<p>True prototype of the nation that was later to adopt him as
its godfather, the shrewd and honest patriot, &ldquo;Uncle
Sam,&rdquo; not only lived loyally up to his contracts, giving
full measure and of his best, but proved himself incorruptible,
making it his business to see that others too fulfilled their
engagements both in the letter and the spirit; so that the
&ldquo;U.S.&rdquo; (abbreviation of United States) which he
pencilled on all provisions that had passed his inspection became
in the eyes of officers and soldiers a guarantee of
excellence.&nbsp; Samuel&rsquo;s old friends, the boys of Troy
(now enlisted in the army), na&iuml;vely imagining that the
mystic initials were an allusion to the pet name they had given
him years before, would accept no meats but &ldquo;Uncle
Sam&rsquo;s,&rdquo; murmuring if other viands were offered
them.&nbsp; Their comrades without inquiry followed this example;
until so strong did the prejudice for food marked
&ldquo;U.S.&rdquo; become, that other contractors, in order that
their provisions should find favor with the soldiers, took to
announcing &ldquo;Uncle Sam&rdquo; brands.</p>
<p>To the greater part of the troops, ignorant (as are most
Americans to-day) of the real origin of this pseudonym,
&ldquo;Uncle Sam&rsquo;s&rdquo; beef and bread meant merely
government provisions, and the step from national belongings to
an impersonation of our country by an ideal &ldquo;Uncle
Sam&rdquo; was but a logical sequence.</p>
<p>In his vigorous old age, Samuel Wilson again lived on Mount
Ida, near the estates of the Warren family, where as children we
were taken to visit his house and hear anecdotes of the aged
patriot&rsquo;s hospitality and humor.&nbsp; The honor in which
he was held by the country-side, the influence for good he
exerted, and the informal tribunal he held, to which his
neighbors came to get their differences straightened out by his
common sense, are still talked of by the older inhabitants.&nbsp;
One story in particular used to charm our boyish ears.&nbsp; It
was about a dispute over land between the Livingstons and the Van
Rensselaers, which was brought to an end by &ldquo;Uncle
Sam&rsquo;s&rdquo; producing a barrel of old papers (confided to
him by both families during the war, for safe keeping) and
extracting from this original &ldquo;strong box&rdquo; title
deeds to the property in litigation.</p>
<p>Now, in these troubled times of ours, when rumors of war are
again in the air, one&rsquo;s thoughts revert with pleasure to
the half-mythical figure on the threshold of the century, and to
legends of the clear-eyed giant, with the quizzical smile and the
tender, loyal heart, whose life&rsquo;s work makes him a more
lovable model and a nobler example to hold up before the youth of
to-day than all the mythological deities that ever disported
themselves on the original Mount Ida.</p>
<p>There is a singular fitness in this choice of &ldquo;Uncle
Sam&rdquo; as our patron saint, for to be honest and loyal and
modest, to love little children, to do one&rsquo;s duty quietly
in the heyday of life, and become a mediator in old age, is to
fulfil about the whole duty of man; and every patriotic heart
must wish the analogy may be long maintained, that our loved
country, like its prototype, may continue the protector of the
feeble and a peace-maker among nations.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 2&mdash;Domestic Despots</h2>
<p>Those who walk through the well-to-do quarters of our city,
and glance, perhaps a little enviously as they pass, toward the
cheerful firesides, do not reflect that in almost every one of
these apparently happy homes a pitiless tyrant reigns, a
misshapen monster without bowels of compassion or thought beyond
its own greedy appetites, who sits like Sinbad&rsquo;s awful
burden on the necks of tender women and distracted men.&nbsp;
Sometimes this incubus takes the form of a pug, sometimes of a
poodle, or simply a bastard cur admitted to the family bosom in a
moment of unreflecting pity; size and pedigree are of no
importance; the result is always the same.&nbsp; Once Caliban is
installed in his stronghold, peace and independence desert that
roof.</p>
<p>We read daily of fathers tyrannizing over trembling families,
of stepmothers and unnatural children turning what might be happy
homes into amateur Infernos, and sigh, as we think of martyrdoms
endured by overworked animals.</p>
<p>It is cheering to know that societies have been formed for the
protection of dumb brutes and helpless children.&nbsp; Will no
attempt be made to alleviate this other form of suffering, which
has apparently escaped the eye of the reformer?</p>
<p>The animal kingdom is divided&mdash;like all Gaul&mdash;into
three divisions: wild beasts, that are obliged to hustle for
themselves; laboring and producing animals, for which man
provides because they are useful to him&mdash;and dogs!&nbsp; Of
all created things on our globe the canine race have the softest
&ldquo;snap.&rdquo;&nbsp; The more one thinks about this curious
exception in their favor the more unaccountable it appears.&nbsp;
We neglect such wild things as we do not slaughter, and exact
toil from domesticated animals in return for their keep.&nbsp;
Dogs alone, shirking all cares and labor, live in idle comfort at
man&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>When that painful family jar broke up the little garden party
in Eden and forced our first parents to work or hunt for a
living, the original Dog (equally disgusted with either
alternative) hit on the luminous idea of posing as the champion
of the disgraced couple, and attached himself to Adam and Eve;
not that he approved of their conduct, but simply because he
foresaw that if he made himself companionable and cosy he would
be asked to stay to dinner.</p>
<p>From that day to the present, with the exception of
occasionally watching sheep and houses&mdash;a lazy occupation at
the best&mdash;and a little light carting in Belgium (dogs were
given up as turn-spits centuries ago, because they performed that
duty badly), no canine has raised a paw to do an honest
day&rsquo;s work, neither has any member of the genus been known
voluntarily to perform a useful act.</p>
<p>How then&mdash;one asks one&rsquo;s self in a wonder&mdash;did
the myth originate that Dog was the friend of Man?&nbsp; Like a
multitude of other fallacies taught to innocent children, this
folly must be unlearned later.&nbsp; Friend of man, indeed!&nbsp;
Why, the &ldquo;Little Brothers of the Rich&rdquo; are guileless
philanthropists in comparison with most canines, and unworthy to
be named in the same breath with them.&nbsp; Dogs discovered
centuries ago that to live in luxury, it was only necessary to
assume an exaggerated affection for some wealthy mortal, and have
since proved themselves past masters in a difficult art in which
few men succeed.&nbsp; The number of human beings who manage to
live on their friends is small, whereas the veriest mongrel cur
contrives to enjoy food and lodging at some dupe&rsquo;s
expense.</p>
<p>Facts such as these, however, have not over-thrown the great
dog myth.&nbsp; One can hardly open a child&rsquo;s book without
coming across some tale of canine intelligence and
devotion.&nbsp; My tender youth was saddened by the story of one
disinterested dog that refused to leave his master&rsquo;s grave
and was found frozen at his post on a bleak winter&rsquo;s
morning.&nbsp; With the experience of years in pet dogs I now
suspect that, instead of acting in this theatrical fashion, that
pup trotted home from the funeral with the most prosperous and
simple-minded couple in the neighborhood, and after a substantial
meal went to sleep by the fire.&nbsp; He must have been a clever
dog to get so much free advertisement, so probably strolled out
to his master&rsquo;s grave the next noon, when people were about
to hear him, and howled a little to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>I have written &ldquo;the richest and most simple minded
couple,&rdquo; because centuries of self-seeking have developed
in these beasts an especial aptitude for spotting possible
victims at a glance.&nbsp; You will rarely find dogs coquetting
with the strong-minded or wasting blandishments where there is
not the probability of immediate profit; but once let even a
puppy get a tenderhearted girl or aged couple under his
influence, no pity will be shown the victims.</p>
<p>There is a house not a square away from Mr. Gerry&rsquo;s
philanthropic headquarters, where a state of things exists
calculated to extract tears from a custom-house official.&nbsp;
Two elderly virgins are there held in bondage by a Minotaur no
bigger than your two fists.&nbsp; These good dames have a taste
for travelling, but change of climate disagrees with their
tyrant.&nbsp; They dislike house-keeping and, like good
Americans, would prefer hotel life, nevertheless they keep up an
establishment in a cheerless side street, with a retinue of
servants, because, forsooth, their satrap exacts a back yard
where he can walk of a morning.&nbsp; These spinsters, although
loving sisters, no longer go about together, Caligula&rsquo;s
nerves being so shaken that solitude upsets them.&nbsp; He would
sooner expire than be left alone with the servant, for the
excellent reason that his bad temper and absurd airs have made
him dangerous enemies below stairs&mdash;and he knows it!</p>
<p>Another household in this city revolves around two brainless,
goggle-eyed beasts, imported at much expense from the slopes of
Fuji-yama.&nbsp; The care that is lavished on those heathen
monsters passes belief.&nbsp; Maids are employed to carry them up
and down stairs, and men are called in the night to hurry for a
doctor when Chi has over-eaten or Fu develops colic; yet their
devoted mistress tells me, with tears in her eyes, that in spite
of this care, when she takes her darlings for a walk they do not
know her from the first stranger that passes, and will follow any
boy who whistles to them in the street.</p>
<p>What revolts me in the character of dogs is that, not content
with escaping from the responsibilities entailed on all the other
inhabitants of our globe by the struggle for existence, these
four-legged Pecksniffs have succeeded in making for themselves a
fallacious reputation for honesty and devotion.&nbsp; What little
lingering belief I had in canine fidelity succumbed then I was
told that St. Bernards&mdash;those models of integrity and
courage&mdash;have fallen into the habit of carrying the flasks
of brandy that the kind monks provide for the succor of snowbound
travellers, to the neighboring hamlets and exchanging the
contents for&mdash;chops!</p>
<p>Will the world ever wake to the true character of these
four-legged impostors and realize that instead of being
disinterested and sincere, most family pets are consummate
hypocrites.&nbsp; Innocent?&nbsp; Pshaw!&nbsp; Their pretty,
coaxing ways and pretences of affection are unadulterated guile;
their ostentatious devotion, simply a clever man&oelig;uvre to
excite interest and obtain unmerited praise.&nbsp; It is useless,
however, to hope that things will change.&nbsp; So long as this
giddy old world goes on waltzing in space, so long shall we
continue to be duped by shams and pin our faith on frauds,
confounding an attractive bearing with a sweet disposition and
mistaking dishevelled hair and eccentric appearance for
brains.&nbsp; Even in the Orient, where dogs have been granted
immunity from other labor on the condition that they organized an
effective street-cleaning department, they have been false to
their trust and have evaded their contracts quite as if they were
Tammany braves, like whom they pass their days in slumber and
their nights in settling private disputes, while the city remains
uncleaned.</p>
<p>I nurse yet another grudge against the canine race!&nbsp; That
Voltaire of a whelp, who imposed himself upon our confiding first
parents, must have had an important pull at headquarters, for he
certainly succeeded in getting the decree concerning beauty and
fitness which applies to all mammals, including man himself,
reversed in favor of dogs, and handed down to his descendants the
secret of making defects and deformities pass current as
qualities.&nbsp; While other animals are valued for sleek coats
and slender proportions, canine monstrosities have always been in
demand.&nbsp; We do not admire squints or protruding under jaws
in our own race, yet bulldogs have persuaded many weak-minded
people that these defects are charming when combined in an
individual of their breed.</p>
<p>The fox in the fable, who after losing his tail tried to make
that bereavement the fashion, failed in his undertaking; Dutch
canal-boat dogs have, however, been successful where the fox
failed, and are to-day pampered and prized for a curtailment that
would condemn any other animal (except perhaps a Manx cat) to a
watery grave at birth.</p>
<p>I can only recall two instances where canine sycophants got
their deserts; the first tale (probably apocryphal) is about a
donkey, for years the silent victim of a little terrier who had
been trained to lead him to water and back.&nbsp; The
dog&mdash;as might have been expected&mdash;abused the situation,
while pretending to be very kind to his charge, never allowed him
to roll on the grass, as he would have liked, or drink in peace,
and harassed the poor beast in many other ways, getting, however,
much credit from the neighbors for devotion and
intelligence.&nbsp; Finally, one day after months of waiting, the
patient victim&rsquo;s chance came.&nbsp; Getting his tormentor
well out into deep water, the donkey quietly sat down on him.</p>
<p>The other tale is true, for I knew the lady who provided in
her will that her entire establishment should be kept up for the
comfort and during the life of the three fat spaniels that had
solaced her declining years.&nbsp; The heirs tried to break the
will and failed; the delighted domestics, seeing before them a
period of repose, proceeded (headed by the portly housekeeper) to
consult a &ldquo;vet&rdquo; as to how the life of the precious
legatees might be prolonged to the utmost.&nbsp; His advice was
to stop all sweets and rich food and give each of the animals at
least three hours of hard exercise a day.&nbsp; From that moment
the lazy brutes led a dog&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Water and the
detested &ldquo;Spratt&ldquo; biscuit, scorned in happier days,
formed their meagre ordinary; instead of somnolent airings in a
softly cushioned landau they were torn from chimney corner
musings to be raced through cold, muddy streets by a groom on
horseback.</p>
<p>Those two tales give me the keenest pleasure.&nbsp; When I am
received on entering a friend&rsquo;s room with a chorus of yelps
and attacked in dark corners by snarling little hypocrites who
fawn on me in their master&rsquo;s presence, I humbly pray that
some such Nemesis may be in store for these <i>faux bonhommes</i>
before they leave this world, as apparently no provision has been
made for their punishment in the next.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 3&mdash;Cyrano, Rostand, Coquelin</h2>
<p>Among the proverbs of Spanish folk-lore there is a saying that
good wine retains its flavor in spite of rude bottles and cracked
cups.&nbsp; The success of M. Rostand&rsquo;s brilliant drama,
<i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, in its English dress proves once more
the truth of this adage.&nbsp; The fun and pathos, the wit and
satire, of the original pierce through the halting, feeble
translation like light through a ragged curtain, dazzling the
spectators and setting their enthusiasm ablaze.</p>
<p>Those who love the theatre at its best, when it appeals to our
finer instincts and moves us to healthy laughter and tears, owe a
debt of gratitude to Richard Mansfield for his courage in giving
us, as far as the difference of language and rhythm would allow,
this <i>chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> unchanged, free from the
mutilations of the adapter, with the author&rsquo;s wishes and
the stage decorations followed into the smallest detail.&nbsp; In
this way we profit by the vast labor and study which Rostand and
Coquelin gave to the original production.</p>
<p>Rumors of the success attained by this play in Paris soon
floated across to us.&nbsp; The two or three French booksellers
here could not import the piece fast enough to meet the ever
increasing demand of our reading public.&nbsp; By the time spring
came, there were few cultivated people who had not read the new
work and discussed its original language and daring
treatment.</p>
<p>On arriving in Paris, my first evening was passed at the Porte
St. Martin.&nbsp; After the piece was over, I dropped into
Coquelin&rsquo;s dressing-room to shake this old acquaintance by
the hand and give him news of his many friends in America.</p>
<p>Coquelin in his dressing-room is one of the most delightful of
mortals.&nbsp; The effort of playing sets his blood in motion and
his wit sparkling.&nbsp; He seemed as fresh and gay that evening
as though there were not five killing acts behind him and the
fatigue of a two-hundred-night run, uninterrupted even by
Sundays, added to his &ldquo;record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the operation of removing his historic nose had been
performed and the actor had resumed his own clothes and features,
we got into his carriage and were driven to his apartment in the
Place de l&rsquo;Etoile, a cosy museum full of comfortable chairs
and priceless bric-&agrave;-brac.&nbsp; The conversation
naturally turned during supper on the piece and this new author
who had sprung in a night from obscurity to a globe-embracing
fame.&nbsp; How, I asked, did you come across the play, and what
decided you to produce it?</p>
<p>Coquelin&rsquo;s reply was so interesting that it will be
better to repeat the actor&rsquo;s own words as he told his tale
over the dismantled table in the tranquil midnight hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had, like most Parisians, known Rostand for some time
as the author of a few graceful verses and a play (<i>Les
Romanesques</i>) which passed almost unnoticed at the
Fran&ccedil;ais.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four years ago Sarah Bernhardt asked me to her
&lsquo;h&ocirc;tel&rsquo; to hear M. Rostand read a play he had
just completed for her.&nbsp; I accepted reluctantly, as at that
moment we were busy at the theatre.&nbsp; I also doubted if there
could be much in the new play to interest me.&nbsp; It was <i>La
Princesse Lointaine</i>.&nbsp; I shall remember that afternoon as
long as I live!&nbsp; From the first line my attention was
riveted and my senses were charmed.&nbsp; What struck me as even
more remarkable than the piece was the masterly power and finish
with which the boyish author delivered his lines.&nbsp; Where, I
asked myself, had he learned that difficult art?&nbsp; The great
actress, always quick to respond to the voice of art, accepted
the play then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the reading was over I walked home with M.
Rostand, and had a long talk with him about his work and
ambitions.&nbsp; When we parted at his door, I said: &lsquo;In my
opinion, you are destined to become the greatest dramatic poet of
the age; I bind myself here and now to take any play you write
(in which there is a part for me) without reading it, to cancel
any engagements I may have on hand, and produce your piece with
the least possible delay.&rsquo; An offer I don&rsquo;t imagine
many young poets have ever received, and which I certainly never
before made to any author.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About six weeks later my new acquaintance dropped in
one morning to read me the sketch he had worked out for a drama,
the title r&ocirc;le of which he thought would please me.&nbsp; I
was delighted with the idea, and told him to go ahead.&nbsp; A
month later we met in the street.&nbsp; On asking him how the
play was progressing, to my astonishment he answered that he had
abandoned that idea and hit upon something entirely
different.&nbsp; Chance had thrown in his way an old volume of
Cyrano de Bergerac&rsquo;s poems, which so delighted him that he
had been reading up the life and death of that unfortunate
poet.&nbsp; From this reading had sprung the idea of making
Cyrano the central figure of a drama laid in the city of
Richelieu, d&rsquo;Artagnan, and the <i>Pr&eacute;cieuses
Ridicules</i>, a seventeenth-century Paris of love and
duelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first this idea struck me as unfortunate.&nbsp; The
elder Dumas had worked that vein so well and so completely, I
doubted if any literary gold remained for another author.&nbsp;
It seemed foolhardy to resuscitate the <i>Three Guardsmen</i>
epoch&mdash;and I doubted if it were possible to carry out his
idea and play an intense and pathetic r&ocirc;le disguised with a
burlesque nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This contrasting of the grotesque and the sentimental
was of course not new.&nbsp; Victor Hugo had broken away from
classic tradition when he made a hunchback the hero of a
drama.&nbsp; There remained, however, the risk of our Parisian
public not accepting the new situation seriously.&nbsp; It seemed
to me like bringing the sublime perilously near the
ridiculous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, Rostand did not share this opinion or my
doubts.&nbsp; He was full of enthusiasm for his piece and
confident of its success.&nbsp; We sat where we had met, under
the trees of the Champs Elys&eacute;es, for a couple of hours,
turning the subject about and looking at the question from every
point of view.&nbsp; Before we parted the poet had convinced
me.&nbsp; The role, as he conceived it, was certainly original,
and therefore tempting, opening vast possibilities before my
dazzled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found out later that Rostand had gone straight home
after that conversation and worked for nearly twenty hours
without leaving the study, where his wife found him at daybreak,
fast asleep with his head on a pile of manuscript.&nbsp; He was
at my rooms the next day before I was up, sitting on the side of
my bed, reading the result of his labor.&nbsp; As the story
unfolded itself I was more and more delighted.&nbsp; His idea of
resuscitating the quaint interior of the H&ocirc;tel de Bourgogne
Theatre was original, and the balcony scene, even in outline,
enchanting.&nbsp; After the reading Rostand dashed off as he had
come, and for many weeks I saw no more of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>La Princesse Lointaine</i> was, in the meantime,
produced by Sarah, first in London and then in Paris.&nbsp; In
the English capital it was a failure; with us it gained a
<i>succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime</i>, the fantastic grace and
lightness of the piece saving it from absolute shipwreck in the
eyes of the literary public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo; continued Coquelin, pushing
aside his plate, a twinkle in his small eyes, &ldquo;is the
reason of this lack of success very difficult to discover?&nbsp;
The Princess in the piece is supposed to be a fairy enchantress
in her sixteenth year.&nbsp; The play turns on her youth and
innocence.&nbsp; Now, honestly, is Sarah, even on the stage, any
one&rsquo;s ideal of youth and innocence?&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
asked so na&iuml;vely that I burst into a laugh, in which my host
joined me.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this grandmamma, like Ellen
Terry, cannot be made to understand that there are r&ocirc;les
she should leave alone, that with all the illusions the stage
lends she can no longer play girlish parts with success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The failure of his play produced the most disastrous
effect on Rostand, who had given up a year of his life to its
composition and was profoundly chagrined by its fall.&nbsp; He
sank into a mild melancholy, refusing for more than eighteen
months to put pen to paper.&nbsp; On the rare occasions when we
met I urged him to pull himself together and rise above
disappointment.&nbsp; Little by little, his friends were able to
awaken his dormant interest and get him to work again on
<i>Cyrano</i>.&nbsp; As he slowly regained confidence and began
taking pleasure once more in his work, the boyish author took to
dropping in on me at impossible morning hours to read some scene
hot from his ardent brain.&nbsp; When seated by my bedside, he
declaimed his lines until, lit at his flame, I would jump out of
bed, and wrapping my dressing-gown hastily around me, seize the
manuscript out of his hands, and, before I knew it, find my self
addressing imaginary audiences, poker in hand, in lieu of a
sword, with any hat that came to hand doing duty for the plumed
headgear of our hero.&nbsp; Little by little, line upon line, the
masterpiece grew under his hands.&nbsp; My career as an actor has
thrown me in with many forms of literary industry and dogged
application, but the power of sustained effort and untiring,
unflagging zeal possessed by that fragile youth surpassed
anything I had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the work began taking form, Rostand hired a place in
the country, so that no visitors or invitations might tempt him
away from his daily toil.&nbsp; Rich, young, handsome, married to
a woman all Paris was admiring, with every door, social or
Bohemian, wide open before his birth and talent, he voluntarily
shut himself up for over a year in a dismal suburb, allowing no
amusement to disturb his incessant toil.&nbsp; Mme. Rostand has
since told me that at one time she seriously feared for his
reason if not for his life, as he averaged ten hours a day steady
work, and when the spell was on him would pass night after night
at his study table, rewriting, cutting, modelling his play, never
contented, always striving after a more expressive adjective, a
more harmonious or original rhyme, casting aside a month&rsquo;s
finished work without a second thought when he judged that
another form expressed his idea more perfectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That no success is cheaply bought I have long known; my
profession above all others is calculated to teach one that
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Rostand&rsquo;s play is the best this century has
produced, and our greatest critics are unanimous in pronouncing
it equal, if not superior, to Victor Hugo&rsquo;s masterpieces,
the young author has not stolen his laurels, but gained them leaf
by leaf during endless midnight hours of brain-wringing
effort&mdash;a price that few in a generation would be willing to
give or capable of giving for fame.&nbsp; The labor had been in
proportion to the success; it always is!&nbsp; I doubt if there
is one word in his &lsquo;duel&rsquo; ballad that has not been
changed again and again for a more fitting expression, as one
might assort the shades of a mosaic until a harmonious whole is
produced.&nbsp; I have there in my desk whole scenes that he
discarded because they were not essential to the action of the
piece.&nbsp; They will probably never be printed, yet are as
brilliant and cost their author as much labor as any that the
public applauded to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our rehearsals proceeded I saw another side of
Rostand&rsquo;s character; the energy and endurance hidden in his
almost effeminate frame astonished us all.&nbsp; He almost lived
at the theatre, drilling each actor, designing each costume,
ordering the setting of each scene.&nbsp; There was not a dress
that he did not copy from some old print, or a <i>passade</i>
that he did not indicate to the humblest member of the
troop.&nbsp; The marvellous diction that I had noticed during the
reading at Sarah&rsquo;s served him now and gave the key to the
entire performance.&nbsp; I have never seen him peevish or
discouraged, but always courteous and cheerful through all those
weary weeks of repetition, when even the most enthusiastic feel
their courage oozing away under the awful grind of afternoon and
evening rehearsal, the latter beginning at midnight after the
regular performance was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news was somehow spread among the theatre-loving
public that something out if the ordinary was in
preparation.&nbsp; The papers took up the tale and repeated it
until the whole capital was keyed up to concert pitch.&nbsp; The
opening night was eagerly awaited by the critics, the literary
and the artistic worlds.&nbsp; When the curtain rose on the first
act there was the emotion of a great event floating in the
air.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Coquelin&rsquo;s face assumed an intense
expression I had rarely seen there before.&nbsp; He was back on
the stage, living over again the glorious hours of that
night&rsquo;s triumph.&nbsp; His breath was coming quick and his
eyes aglow with the memory of that evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,
never have I lived through such an evening.&nbsp; Victor
Hugo&rsquo;s greatest triumph, the first night of <i>Hernani</i>,
was the only theatrical event that can compare to it.&nbsp; It,
however, was injured by the enmity of a clique who persistently
hissed the new play.&nbsp; There is but one phrase to express the
enthusiasm at our first performance&mdash;<i>une salle en
d&eacute;lire</i> gives some idea of what took place.&nbsp; As
the curtain fell on each succeeding act the entire audience would
rise to its feet, shouting and cheering for ten minutes at a
time.&nbsp; The coulisse and the dressing-rooms were packed by
the critics and the author&rsquo;s friends, beside themselves
with delight.&nbsp; I was trembling so I could hardly get from
one costume into another, and had to refuse my door to every
one.&nbsp; Amid all this confusion Rostand alone remained cool
and seemed unconscious of his victory.&nbsp; He continued quietly
giving last recommendations to the figurants, overseeing the
setting of the scenes, and thanking the actors as they came off
the stage, with the same self-possessed urbanity he had shown
during the rehearsals.&nbsp; Finally, when the play was over, and
we had time to turn and look for him, our author had disappeared,
having quietly driven off with his wife to their house in the
country, from which he never moved for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck two o&rsquo;clock as Coquelin ended.&nbsp; The
sleepless city had at last gone to rest.&nbsp; At our feet, as we
stood by the open window, the great square around the Arc de
Triomphe lay silent and empty, its vast arch rising dimly against
the night sky.</p>
<p>As I turned to go, Coquelin took my hand and remarked,
smiling: &ldquo;Now you have heard the story of a genius, an
actor, and a masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 4&mdash;Machine-made Men</h2>
<p>Among the commonplace white and yellow envelopes that compose
the bulk of one&rsquo;s correspondence, appear from time to time
dainty epistles on tinted paper, adorned with crests or
monograms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; I think when one of these
appears, &ldquo;here is something worth opening!&rdquo;&nbsp; For
between ourselves, reader mine, old bachelors love to receive
notes from women.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so flattering to be remembered
by the dear creatures, and recalls the time when life was
beginning, and <i>poulets</i> in feminine writing suggested such
delightful possibilities.</p>
<p>Only this morning an envelope of delicate Nile green caused me
a distinct thrill of anticipation.&nbsp; To judge by appearances
it could contain nothing less attractive than a declaration, so,
tearing it hurriedly open, I read: &ldquo;Messrs. Sparks &amp;
Splithers take pleasure in calling attention to their patent
suspenders and newest designs in reversible paper
collars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, if that&rsquo;s not enough to put any man in a bad humor
for twenty-four hours, I should like to know what is?&nbsp;
Moreover, I have &ldquo;patents&rdquo; in horror, experience
having long ago revealed the fact that a patent is pretty sure to
be only a new way of doing fast and cheaply something that
formerly was accomplished slowly and well.</p>
<p>Few people stop to think how quickly this land of ours is
degenerating into a paradise of the cheap and nasty, but allow
themselves to be heated and cooled and whirled about the streets
to the detriment of their nerves and digestions, under the
impression that they are enjoying the benefits of modern
progress.</p>
<p>So complex has life become in these later days that the very
beds we lie on and the meals we eat are controlled by
patents.&nbsp; Every garment and piece of furniture now pays a
&ldquo;royalty&rdquo; to some inventor, from the hats on our
heads to the carpets under foot, which latter are not only
manufactured, but cleaned and shaken by machinery, and (be it
remarked <i>en passant</i>) lose their nap prematurely in the
process.&nbsp; To satisfy our national love of the new, an
endless and nameless variety of trifles appears each season,
so-called labor and time-saving combinations, that enjoy a brief
hour of vogue, only to make way for a newer series of
inventions.</p>
<p>As long as our geniuses confined themselves to making life one
long and breathless scramble, it was bad enough, but a line
should have been drawn where meddling with the sanctity of the
toilet began.&nbsp; This, alas! was not done.&nbsp; Nothing has
remained sacred to the inventor.&nbsp; In consequence, the
average up-to-date American is a walking collection of Yankee
notions, an ingenious illusion, made up of patents, requiring as
nice adjustment to put together and undo as a thirteenth-century
warrior, and carrying hardly less metal about his person than a
Crusader of old.</p>
<p>There are a number of haberdashery shops on Broadway that have
caused me to waste many precious minutes gazing into their
windows and wondering what the strange instruments of steel and
elastic could be, that were exhibited alongside of the socks and
ties.&nbsp; The uses of these would, in all probability, have
remained wrapped in mystery but for the experience of one fateful
morning (after a night in a sleeping-car), when countless hidden
things were made clear, as I sat, an awestruck witness to my
fellow-passengers&rsquo;&mdash;toilets?&mdash;No!&nbsp; Getting
their machinery into running order for the day, would be a more
correct expression.</p>
<p>Originally, &ldquo;tags&rdquo; were the backbone of the
toilet, different garments being held together by their
aid.&nbsp; Later, buttons and attendant button-holes were
evolved, now replaced by the devices used in composing the
machine-made man.&nbsp; As far as I could see (I have overcome a
natural delicacy in making my discoveries public, because it
seems unfair to keep all this information to myself), nothing so
archaic as a button-hole is employed at the present time by our
patent-ridden compatriots.&nbsp; The shirt, for instance, which
was formerly such a simple-minded and straightforward garment,
knowing no guile, has become, in the hands of the inventors, a
mere pretence, a frail scaffold, on which an elaborate
superstructure of shams is erected.</p>
<p>The varieties of this garment that one sees in the shop
windows, exposing virgin bosoms to the day, are not what they
seem!&nbsp; Those very bosoms are fakes, and cannot open, being
instead pierced by eyelets, into which bogus studs are fixed by
machinery.&nbsp; The owner is obliged to enter into those
deceptive garments surreptitiously from the rear, by stratagem,
as it were.&nbsp; Why all this trouble, one asks, for no apparent
reason, except that old-fashioned shirts opened in front, and no
Yankee will wear a non-patented garment&mdash;if he can help
it?</p>
<p>There was not a single accessory to the toilet in that car
which behaved in a normal way.&nbsp; Buttons mostly backed into
place, tail-end foremost (like horses getting between shafts),
where some hidden mechanism screwed or clinched them to their
moorings.</p>
<p>Collars and cuffs (integral parts of the primitive garment)
are now a labyrinth, in which all but the initiated must lose
themselves, being double-decked, detachable, reversible, and made
of every known substance except linen.&nbsp; The cuff most in
favor can be worn four different ways, and is attached to the
shirt by a steel instrument three inches long, with a nipper at
each end.&nbsp; The amount of white visible below the coat-sleeve
is regulated by another contrivance, mostly of elastic, worn
further up the arm, around the biceps.&nbsp; Modern collars are
retained in position by a system of screws and levers.&nbsp;
Socks are attached no longer with the old-fashioned garter, but
by aid of a little harness similar to that worn by pug-dogs.</p>
<p>One traveller, after lacing his shoes, adjusted a contrivance
resembling a black beetle on the knot to prevent its
untying.&nbsp; He also wore &ldquo;hygienic suspenders,&rdquo; a
discovery of great importance (over three thousand patents have
been taken out for this one necessity of the toilet!).&nbsp; This
brace performs several tasks at the same time, such as holding
unmentionable garments in place, keeping the wearer erect, and
providing a night-key guard.&nbsp; It is also said to cure liver
and kidney disease by means of an arrangement of pulleys which
throw the strain according to the wearer&rsquo;s position&mdash;I
omit the rest of its qualities!</p>
<p>The watches of my companions, I noticed with astonishment, all
wore India-rubber ruffs around their necks.&nbsp; Here curiosity
getting the better of discretion, I asked what purpose that
invention served.&nbsp; It was graciously explained to me how
such ruffs prevented theft.&nbsp; They were so made that it was
impossible to draw your watch out of a pocket unless you knew the
trick, which struck me as a mitigated blessing.&nbsp; In fact,
the idea kept occurring that life might become terribly
uncomfortable under these complex conditions for absent-minded
people.</p>
<p>Pencils, I find, are no longer put into pockets or slipped
behind the ear.&nbsp; Every commercial &ldquo;gent&rdquo; wears a
patent on his chest, where his pen and pencil nestle in a coil of
wire.&nbsp; Eyeglasses are not allowed to dangle aimlessly about,
as of old, but retire with a snap into an oval box, after the
fashion of roller shades.&nbsp; Scarf-pins have guards screwed on
from behind, and undergarments&mdash;but here modesty stops my
pen.</p>
<p>Seeing that I was interested in their make-up, several
travelling agents on the train got out their boxes and showed me
the latest artifices that could be attached to the person.&nbsp;
One gentleman produced a collection of rings made to go on the
finger with a spring, like bracelets, an arrangement, he
explained, that was particularly convenient for people afflicted
with enlarged joints!</p>
<p>Another tempted me with what he called a &ldquo;literary shirt
front,&rdquo;&mdash;it was in fact a paper pad, from which for
cleanliness a leaf could be peeled each morning; the
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; side of the sheet thus removed contained a
calendar, much useful information, and the chapters of a
&ldquo;continued&rdquo; story, which ended when the
&ldquo;dickey&rdquo; was used up.</p>
<p>A third traveller was &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; a collar-button
that plied as many trades as Figaro, combining the functions of
cravat-holder, stud, and scarf-pin.&nbsp; Not being successful in
selling me one of these, he brought forward something
&rdquo;without which,&rdquo; he assured me, &ldquo;no
gentleman&rsquo;s wardrobe was complete&rdquo;!&nbsp; It proved
to be an insidious arrangement of gilt wire, which he adjusted on
his poor, overworked collar-button, and then tied his cravat
through and around it.&nbsp; &ldquo;No tie thus made,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;would ever slip or get crooked.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
been so civil that it was embarrassing not to buy something of
him; I invested twenty-five cents in the cravat-holder, as it
seemed the least complicated of the patents on exhibition; not,
however, having graduated in a school of mechanics I have never
been able to make it work.&nbsp; It takes an hour to tie a cravat
with its aid, and as long to get it untied.&nbsp; Most of the men
in that car, I found, got around the difficulty by wearing
ready-made ties which fastened behind with a clasp.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the reason our compatriots have
such a strained and anxious look is because they are all trying
to remember the numbers of their streets and houses, the floor
their office is on, and the combination of their safes.&nbsp; I
am inclined to think that the hunted look we wear comes from an
awful fear of forgetting the secrets of our patents and being
unable to undo ourselves in an emergency!</p>
<p>Think for a moment of the horror of coming home tired and
sleepy after a convivial evening, and finding that some of your
hidden machinery had gone wrong; that by a sudden movement you
had disturbed the nice balance of some lever which in revenge
refused to release its prey!&nbsp; The inventors of one
well-known cuff-holder claim that it had a &ldquo;bull-dog
grip.&rdquo;&nbsp; Think of sitting dressed all night in the
embrace of that mechanical canine until the inventor could be
called in to set you free!</p>
<p>I never doubted that bravery was the leading characteristic of
the American temperament; since that glimpse into the secret
composition of my compatriots, admiration has been vastly
increased.&nbsp; The foolhardy daring it must
require&mdash;dressed as those men were&mdash;to go out in a
thunder-storm makes one shudder: it certainly could not be found
in any other race.&nbsp; The danger of cross-country hunting or
bull-fighting is as nothing compared to the risk a modern
American takes when he sits in a trolley-car, where the chances
of his machinery forming a fatal &ldquo;short circuit&rdquo; must
be immense.&nbsp; The utter impossibility in which he finds
himself of making a toilet quickly on account of so many
time-saving accessories must increase his chances of getting
&ldquo;left&rdquo; in an accident about fifty per cent.&nbsp; Who
but one of our people could contemplate with equanimity the
thought of attempting the adjustment of such delicate and
difficult combinations while a steamer was sinking and the
life-boats being manned?</p>
<p>Our grandfathers contributed the wooden nutmeg to
civilization, and endowed a grateful universe with other
money-saving devices.&nbsp; To-day the inventor takes the
American baby from his cradle and does not release him even at
the grave.&nbsp; What a treat one of the machine-made men of
to-day will be to the archeologists of the year 3000, when they
chance upon a well-preserved specimen, with all his patents thick
upon I him!&nbsp; With a prophetic eye one can almost see the
kindly old gentleman of that day studying the paraphernalia found
in the tomb and attempting to account for the different
pieces.&nbsp; Ink will flow and discussions rage between the camp
maintaining that cuff-holders were tutelar deities buried with
the dead by pious relatives and the croup asserting that the
little pieces of steel were a form of pocket money in the year
1900.&nbsp; Both will probably misquote Tennyson and Kipling in
support of their theories.</p>
<p>The question has often been raised, What side of our
nineteenth-century civilization will be most admired by future
generations?&nbsp; In view of the above facts there can remain
little doubt that when the secrets of the paper collar and the
trouser-stretcher have become lost arts, it will be those
benefits that remote ages will envy us, and rare specimens of
&ldquo;ventilated shoes&rdquo; and &ldquo;reversible tissue-paper
undergarments&rdquo; will form the choicest treasures of the
collector.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 5&mdash;Parnassus</h2>
<p>Many years ago, a gentleman with whom I was driving in a
distant quarter of Paris took me to a house on the rue
Montparnasse, where we remained an hour or more, he chatting with
its owner, and I listening to their conversation, and wondering
at the confusion of books in the big room.&nbsp; As we drove
away, my companion turned to me and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
forget this afternoon.&nbsp; You have seen one of the greatest
writers our century has produced, although the world does not yet
realize it.&nbsp; You will learn to love his works when you are
older, and it will be a satisfaction to remember that you saw and
spoke with him in the flesh! &ldquo;</p>
<p>When I returned later to Paris the little house had changed
hands, and a marble tablet stating that Sainte-Beuve had lived
and died there adorned its fa&ccedil;ade.&nbsp; My student
footsteps took me many times through that quiet street, but never
without a vision of the poet-critic flashing back, as I glanced
up at the window where he had stood and talked with us; as my
friend predicted, Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s writings had become a
precious part of my small library, the memory of his genial face
adding a vivid interest to their perusal.</p>
<p>I made a little Pilgrimage recently to the quiet old garden
where, after many years&rsquo; delay, a bust of this writer has
been unveiled, with the same companion, now very old, who thirty
years ago presented me to the original.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, in all Paris no more exquisite corner than
the Garden of the Luxembourg.&nbsp; At every season it is
beautiful.&nbsp; The winter sunlight seems to linger on its
stately Italian terraces after it has ceased to shine
elsewhere.&nbsp; The first lilacs bloom here in the spring, and
when midsummer has turned all the rest of Paris into a blazing,
white wilderness, these gardens remain cool and tranquil in the
heart of turbulent &ldquo;Bohemia,&rdquo; a bit of fragrant
nature filled with the song of birds and the voices of
children.&nbsp; Surely it was a gracious inspiration that
selected this shady park as the &ldquo;Poets&rsquo; Corner&rdquo;
of great, new Paris.&nbsp; Henri Murger, Leconte de Lisle,
Th&eacute;odore de Banville, Paul Verlaine, are here, and now
Sainte-Beuve has come back to his favorite haunt.&nbsp; Like
Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e and Victor Hugo, he loved these
historic <i>all&eacute;es</i>, and knew the stone in them as he
knew the &ldquo;Latin Quater,&rdquo; for his life was passed
between the bookstalls of the quays and the outlying street where
he lived.</p>
<p>As we sat resting in the shade, my companion, who had been one
of Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s pupils, fell to talking of his master,
his memory refreshed by the familiar surroundings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can anything be sadder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than
finding a face one has loved turned into stone, or names that
were the watchwords of one&rsquo;s youth serving as signs at
street corners&mdash;la rue Flaubert or Th&eacute;odore de
Banville?&nbsp; How far away they make the past seem!&nbsp; Poor
Sainte-Beuve, that bust yonder is but a poor reward for a life of
toil, a modest tribute to his encyclop&aelig;dic brain!&nbsp; His
works, however, are his best monument; he would be the last to
repine or cavil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The literary world of my day had two poles, between
which it vibrated.&nbsp; The little house in the rue Montparnasse
was one, the rock of Guernsey the other.&nbsp; We spoke with awe
of &lsquo;Father Hugo&rsquo; and mentioned &lsquo;Uncle
Beuve&rsquo; with tenderness.&nbsp; The Goncourt brothers
accepted Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s judgment on their work as the
verdict of a &lsquo;Supreme Court.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not a poet or
author of that day but climbed with a beating heart the narrow
staircase that led to the great writer&rsquo;s library.&nbsp;
Paul Verlaine regarded as his literary diploma a letter from this
&lsquo;Balzac de la critique.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the entrance of the quaint Passage du Commerce,
under the arch that leads into the rue
Saint-Andr&eacute;-des-Arts, stands a hotel, where for years
Sainte-Beuve came daily to work (away from the importunate who
besieged his dwelling) in a room hired under the assumed name of
Delorme.&nbsp; It was there that we sent him a basket of fruit
one morning addressed to Mr. Delorme, <i>n&eacute;</i>
Sainte-Beuve.&nbsp; It was there that most of his enormous labor
was accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A curious corner of old Paris that Cour du
Commerce!&nbsp; Just opposite his window was the apartment where
Danton lived.&nbsp; If one chose to seek for them it would not be
hard to discover on the pavement of this same passage the marks
made by a young doctor in decapitating sheep with his newly
invented machine.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s name was
Guillotin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great critic loved these old quarters filled with
history.&nbsp; He was fond of explaining that Montparnasse had
been a hill where the students of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries came to amuse themselves.&nbsp; In 1761 the slope was
levelled and the boulevard laid out, but the name was
predestined, he would declare, for the habitation of the
&lsquo;Parnassiens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His enemies pretended that you had but to mention
Michelet, Balzac, and Victor Hugo to see Sainte-Beuve in three
degrees of rage.&nbsp; He had, it is true, distinct expressions
on hearing those authors discussed.&nbsp; The phrase then much
used in speaking of an original personality, &lsquo;He is like a
character out of Balzac,&rsquo; always threw my master into a
temper.&nbsp; I cannot remember, however, having seen him in one
of those famous rages which made Barbey d&rsquo;Aur&eacute;villy
say that &lsquo;Sainte-Beuve was a clever man with the temper of
a turkey!&rsquo;&nbsp; The former was much nearer the truth when
he called the author of <i>Les Lundis</i> a French Wordsworth, or
compared him to a lay <i>b&eacute;n&eacute;dictin</i>.&nbsp; He
had a way of reading a newly acquired volume as he walked through
the streets that was typical of his life.&nbsp; My master was
always studying and always advancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never entirely recovered from his mortification at
being hissed by the students on the occasion of his first lecture
at the Coll&egrave;ge de France.&nbsp; Returning home he loaded
two pistols, one for the first student who should again insult
him, and the other to blow out his own brains.&nbsp; It was no
idle threat.&nbsp; The man Guizot had nicknamed
&lsquo;Werther&rsquo; was capable of executing his plan, for this
causeless unpopularity was anguish to him.&nbsp; After his death,
I found those two pistols loaded in his bedroom, but justice had
been done another way.&nbsp; All opposition had vanished.&nbsp;
Every student in the &lsquo;Quarter&rsquo; followed the modest
funeral of their Senator, who had become the champion of literary
liberty in an epoch when poetry was held in chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Empire which made him Senator gained, however, but
an indocile recruit.&nbsp; On his one visit to Compi&egrave;gne
in 1863, the Emperor, wishing to be particularly gracious, said
to him, &lsquo;I always read the <i>Moniteur</i> on Monday, when
your article appears.&rsquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately for this
compliment, it was the <i>Constitutionnel</i> that had been
publishing the <i>Nouveaux Lundis</i> for more than four
years.&nbsp; In spite of the united efforts of his friends,
Sainte-Beuve could not be brought to the point of complimenting
Napoleon III. on his <i>Life of C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>
<p>The author of <i>Les Consolations</i> remained through life
the proudest and most independent of men, a bourgeois, enemy of
all tyranny, asking protection of no one.&nbsp; And what a
worker!&nbsp; Reading, sifting, studying, analyzing his subject
before composing one of his famous <i>Lundis</i>, a literary
portrait which he aimed at making complete and final.&nbsp; One
of these articles cost him as much labor as other authors give to
the composition of a volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By way of amusement on Sunday evenings, when work was
temporarily laid aside, he loved the theatre, delighting in every
kind of play, from the broad farces of the Palais Royal to the
tragedies of Racine, and entertaining comedians in order, as he
said, &lsquo;to keep young&rsquo;!&nbsp; One evening
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier brought a pretty actress to
dinner.&nbsp; Sainte-Beuve, who was past-master in the difficult
art of conversation, and on whom a fair woman acted as an
inspiration, surpassed himself on this occasion, surprising even
the Goncourts with his knowledge of the Eighteenth century and
the women of that time, Mme. de Boufflers, Mlle. de Lespinasse,
la Mar&eacute;chale de Luxembourg.&nbsp; The hours flew by
unheeded by all of his guests but one.&nbsp; The
<i>d&eacute;butante</i> was overheard confiding, later in the
evening, to a friend at the Gymnase, where she performed in the
last act, &lsquo;Ouf!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to get here.&nbsp;
I&lsquo;ve been dining with a stupid old Senator.&nbsp; They told
me he would be amusing, but I&rsquo;ve been bored to
death.&rsquo;&nbsp; Which reminded me of my one visit to England,
when I heard a young nobleman declare that he had been to
&lsquo;such a dull dinner to meet a duffer called
&ldquo;Renan!&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s <i>Larmes de Racine</i> was given
at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais during its
author&rsquo;s last illness.&nbsp; His disappointment at not
seeing the performance was so keen that M. Thierry, then
<i>administrateur</i> of La Com&eacute;die, took Mlle. Favart to
the rue Montparnasse, that she might recite his verses to the
dying writer.&nbsp; When the actress, then in the zenith of her
fame and beauty, came to the lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Jean Racine, le grand po&ecirc;te,<br />
Le po&ecirc;te aimant et pieux,<br />
Apr&egrave;s que sa lyre muette<br />
Se fut voil&egrave;e &agrave; tous les yeux,<br />
Renon&ccedil;ant &agrave; la gloire humaine,<br />
S&rsquo;il sentait en son &acirc;me pleine<br />
Le flot contenu murmurer,<br />
Ne savait que fondre en pri&egrave;re,<br />
Pencher l&rsquo;urne dans la poussi&egrave;re<br />
Aux pieds du Seigneur, et pleurer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the tears of Sainte-Beuve accompanied those of
Racine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears also in the eyes my companion turned toward
me as he concluded.&nbsp; The sun had set while he had been
speaking.&nbsp; The marble of the statues gleamed white against
the shadows of the sombre old garden.&nbsp; The guardians were
closing the gates and warning the lingering visitors as we
strolled toward the entrance.</p>
<p>It seemed as if we had been for an hour in the presence of the
portly critic; and the circle of brilliant men and witty women
who surrounded him&mdash;Flaubert, Tourgu&eacute;neff,
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, Renan, George Sand&mdash;were realities
at that moment, not abstractions with great names.&nbsp; It was
like returning from another age, to step out again into the glare
and bustle of the Boulevard St. Michel.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 6&mdash;Modern Architecture</h2>
<p>If a foreign tourist, ignorant of his whereabouts, were to
sail about sunset up our spacious bay and view for the first time
the eccentric sky-line of lower New York, he would rub his eyes
and wonder if they were not playing him a trick, for distance and
twilight lend the chaotic masses around the Battery a certain
wild grace suggestive of Titan strongholds or prehistoric abodes
of Wotan, rather than the business part of a practical modern
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; as John Drew used to say in <i>The Masked
Ball</i>, &ldquo;what a difference in the morning!&rdquo; when a
visit to his banker takes the new arrival down to Wall Street,
and our uncompromising American daylight dispels his
illusions.</p>
<p>Years ago <i>spiritual</i> Arthur Gilman mourned over the
decay of architecture in New York and pointed out that
Stewart&rsquo;s shop, at Tenth Street, bore about the same
relation to Ictinus&rsquo; noble art as an iron cooking
stove!&nbsp; It is well death removed the Boston critic before
our city entered into its present Brobdingnagian phase.&nbsp; If
he considered that Stewart&rsquo;s and the Fifth Avenue Hotel
failed in artistic beauty, what would have been his opinion of
the graceless piles that crowd our island to-day, beside which
those older buildings seem almost classical in their
simplicity?</p>
<p>One hardly dares to think what impression a student familiar
with the symmetry of Old World structures must receive on
arriving for the first time, let us say, at the Bowling Green,
for the truth would then dawn upon him that what appeared from a
distance to be the ground level of the island was in reality the
roof line of average four-story buildings, from among which the
keeps and campaniles that had so pleased him (when viewed from
the Narrows) rise like gigantic weeds gone to seed in a field of
grass.</p>
<p>It is the heterogeneous character of the buildings down town
that renders our streets so hideous.&nbsp; Far from seeking
harmony, builders seem to be trying to &ldquo;go&rdquo; each
other &ldquo;one story better&rdquo;; if they can belittle a
neighbor in the process it is clear gain, and so much
advertisement.&nbsp; Certain blocks on lower Broadway are gems in
this way!&nbsp; Any one who has glanced at an auctioneer&rsquo;s
shelves when a &ldquo;job lot&rdquo; of books is being sold, will
doubtless have noticed their resemblance to the sidewalks of our
down town streets.&nbsp; Dainty little duodecimo buildings are
squeezed in between towering in-folios, and richly bound and
tooled octavos chum with cheap editions.&nbsp; Our careless City
Fathers have not even given themselves the trouble of pushing
their stone and brick volumes into the same line, but allow them
to straggle along the shelf&mdash;I beg pardon, the
sidewalk&mdash;according to their own sweet will.</p>
<p>The resemblance of most new business buildings to flashy books
increases the more one studies them; they have the proportions of
school atlases, and, like them, are adorned only on their backs
(read fronts).&nbsp; The modern builder, like the frugal binder,
leaves the sides of his creations unadorned, and expends his
ingenuity in decorating the narrow strip which he naively
imagines will be the only part seen, calmly ignoring the fact
that on glancing up or down a street the sides of houses are what
we see first.&nbsp; It is almost impossible to get mathematically
opposite a building, yet that is the only point from which these
new constructions are not grotesque.</p>
<p>It seems as though the rudiments of common sense would suggest
that under existing circumstances the less decoration put on a
fa&ccedil;ade the greater would be the harmony of the
whole.&nbsp; But trifles like harmony and fitness are splendidly
ignored by the architects of to-day, who, be it remarked in
passing, have slipped into another curious habit for which I
should greatly like to see an explanation offered.&nbsp; As long
as the ground floors and the tops of their creations are
elaborate, the designer evidently thinks the intervening twelve
or fifteen stories can shift for themselves.&nbsp; One clumsy
mass on the Bowling Green is an excellent example of this
weakness.&nbsp; Its ground floor is a playful reproduction of the
tombs of Egypt.&nbsp; About the second story the architect must
have become discouraged&mdash;or perhaps the owner&rsquo;s funds
gave out&mdash;for the next dozen floors are treated in the
severest &ldquo;tenement house&rdquo; manner; then, as his
building terminates well up in the sky, a top floor or two are,
for no apparent reason, elaborately adorned.&nbsp; Indeed, this
desire for a brilliant finish pervades the neighborhood.&nbsp;
The Johnson Building on Broad Street (to choose one out of the
many) is sober and discreet in design for a dozen stories, but
bursts at its top into a Byzantine colonnade.&nbsp; Why? one asks
in wonder.</p>
<p>Another new-comer, corner of Wall and Nassau Streets, is a
commonplace structure, with a fairly good cornice, on top of
which&mdash;an afterthought, probably&mdash;a miniature State
Capitol has been added, with dome and colonnade complete.&nbsp;
The result recalls dear, absent-minded Miss Matty (in Mrs.
Gaskell&rsquo;s charming story), when she put her best cap on top
of an old one and sat smiling at her visitors from under the
double headdress!</p>
<p>Nowhere in the world&mdash;not even in Moscow, that city of
domes&mdash;can one see such a collection of pagodas, cupolas,
kiosks, and turrets as grace the roofs of our office
buildings!&nbsp; Architects evidently look upon such adornments
as compensations!&nbsp; The more hideous the structure, the finer
its dome!&nbsp; Having perpetrated a blot upon the city that
cries to heaven in its enormity, the repentant owner adds a
pagoda or two, much in the same spirit, doubtless, as prompts an
Italian peasant to hang a votive heart on some friendly shrine
when a crime lies heavy on his conscience.</p>
<p>What would be thought of a book-collector who took to standing
inkstands or pepperboxes on the tops of his tallest volumes by
way of adornment?&nbsp; Yet domes on business buildings are every
bit as appropriate.&nbsp; A choice collection of those
monstrosities graces Park Row, one much-gilded offender varying
the monotony by looking like a yellow stopper in a
high-shouldered bottle!&nbsp; How modern architects with the
exquisite City Hall before them could have wandered so far afield
in their search for the original must always remain a
mystery.</p>
<p>When a tall, thin building happens to stand on a corner, the
likeness to an atlas is replaced by a grotesque resemblance to a
waffle iron, of which one structure just finished on Rector
Street skilfully reproduces&rsquo; the lines.&nbsp; The rows of
little windows were evidently arranged to imitate the
indentations on that humble utensil, and the elevated road at the
back seems in this case to do duty as the handle.&nbsp; Mrs. Van
Rensselaer tells us in her delightful <i>Goede Vrouw of
Mana-ha-ta</i> that waffle irons used to be a favorite wedding
present among the Dutch settlers of this island, and were adorned
with monograms and other devices, so perhaps it is atavism that
makes us so fond of this form in building!&nbsp; As, however, no
careful <i>Hausfrau</i> would have stood her iron on its edge,
architects should hesitate before placing their buildings in that
position, as the impression of instability is the same in each
case.</p>
<p>After leaving the vicinity of the City Hall, the tall slabs
that like magnified milestones mark the progress of Architecture
up Broadway become a shade less objectionable, although one meets
some strange freaks in so-called decoration by the way.&nbsp;
Why, for instance, were those Titan columns grouped around the
entrance to the American Surety Company&rsquo;s building?&nbsp;
They do not support anything (the &ldquo;business&rdquo; of
columns in architecture) except some rather feeble statuary, and
do seriously block the entrance.&nbsp; Were they added with the
idea of fitness?&nbsp; That can hardly be, for a portico is as
inappropriate to such a building as it would be to a parlor car,
and almost as inconvenient.</p>
<p>Farther up town our attention is arrested by another misplaced
adornment.&nbsp; What purpose can that tomb with a railing round
it serve on top of the New York Life Insurance building?&nbsp; It
looks like a monument in Greenwood, surmounted by a rat-trap, but
no one is interred there, and vermin can hardly be troublesome at
that altitude.</p>
<p>How did this craze for decoration originate?&nbsp; The
inhabitants of Florence and Athens did not consider it
necessary.&nbsp; There must, I feel sure, be a reason for its use
in this city; American land-lords rarely spend money without a
purpose; perhaps they find that rococo detail draws business and
inspires confidence!</p>
<p>I should like to ask the architects of New York one question:
Have they not been taught that in their art, as in every other,
pretences are vulgar, that things should be what they seem?&nbsp;
Then why do they continue to hide steel and fire-brick cages
under a veneer of granite six inches thick, causing them to pose
as solid stone buildings?&nbsp; If there is a demand for tall,
light structures, why not build them simply (as bridges are
constructed), and not add a poultice of bogus columns and zinc
cornices that serve no purpose and deceive no one?</p>
<p>Union Square possesses blocks out of which the Jackson and
Decker buildings spring with a noble disregard of all rules and a
delicious incongruity that reminds one of Falstaff&rsquo;s corps
of ill-drilled soldiers.&nbsp; Madison Square, however, is
<i>facile princeps</i>, with its annex to the Hoffman House, a
building which would make the fortune of any dime museum that
could fence it in and show it for a fee!&nbsp; Long contemplation
of this structure from my study window has printed every comic
detail on my brain.&nbsp; It starts off at the ground level to be
an imitation of the Doge&rsquo;s Palace (a neat and appropriate
idea in itself for a Broadway shop).&nbsp; At the second story,
following the usual New York method, it reverts to a design
suggestive of a county jail (the Palace and the Prison), with
here and there a balcony hung out, emblematical, doubtless, of
the inmates&rsquo; wash and bedding.&nbsp; At the ninth floor the
repentant architect adds two more stories in memory of the
Doge&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp; Have you ever seen an accordion
(concertina, I believe, is the correct name) hanging in a shop
window?&nbsp; The Twenty-fifth Street Doge&rsquo;s Palace reminds
me of that humble instrument.&nbsp; The wooden part, where the
keys and round holes are, stands on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Then come
an indefinite number of pleats, and finally the other wooden end
well up among the clouds.&nbsp; So striking is this resemblance
that at times one expects to hear the long-drawn moans peculiar
to the concertina issuing from those portals.&nbsp; Alas! even
the most original designs have their drawbacks!&nbsp; After the
proprietor of the Venetian accordion had got his instrument well
drawn out and balanced on its end, he perceived that it dwarfed
the adjacent buildings, so cast about in his mind for a scheme to
add height and dignity to the rest of the block.&nbsp; One day
the astonished neighborhood saw what appeared to be a
&ldquo;roomy suburban villa&rdquo; of iron rising on the roof of
the old Hoffman House.&nbsp; The results suggests a small man
who, being obliged to walk with a giant, had put on a hat several
times too large in order to equalize their heights!</p>
<p>How astonished Pericles and his circle of architects and
sculptors would be could they stand on the corner of Broadway and
Twenty-eighth Street and see the miniature Parthenon that graces
the roof of a pile innocent of other Greek ornament?&nbsp; They
would also recognize their old friends, the ladies of the
Erechtheum, doing duty on the Reveillon Building across the way,
pretending to hold up a cornice, which, being in proportion to
the building, is several hundred times too big for them to
carry.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t be seen from the
sidewalk,&mdash;the street is too narrow for that,&mdash;but such
trifles don&rsquo;t deter builders from decorating when the fit
is on them.&nbsp; Perhaps this one got his caryatides at a
bargain, and had to work them in somewhere; so it is not fair to
be hard on him.</p>
<p>If ever we take to ballooning, all these elaborate tops may
add materially to our pleasure.&nbsp; At the present moment the
birds, and angels, it is to be hoped, appreciate the
effort.&nbsp; I, perhaps, of all the inhabitants of the city,
have seen those ladies face to face, when I have gone on a
semi-monthly visit to my roof to look for leaks!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to carp and cavil,&rdquo; many
readers will say, &ldquo;but &lsquo;Idler&rsquo; forgets that our
modern architects have had to contend with difficulties that the
designers of other ages never faced, demands for space and light
forcing the nineteenth-century builders to produce structures
which they know are neither graceful nor in
proportion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If my readers will give themselves the trouble to glance at
several office buildings in the city, they will realize that the
problem is not without a solution.&nbsp; In almost every case
where the architect has refrained from useless decoration and
stuck to simple lines, the result, if not beautiful, has at least
been inoffensive.&nbsp; It is where inappropriate elaboration is
added that taste is offended.&nbsp; Such structures as the Singer
building, corner of Liberty Street and Broadway, and the home of
<i>Life</i>, in Thirty-first Street, prove that beauty and grace
of fa&ccedil;ade can be adapted to modern business wants.</p>
<p>Feeling as many New Yorkers do about this defacing of what
might have been the most beautiful of modern cities, it is
galling to be called upon to admire where it is already an effort
to tolerate.</p>
<p>A sprightly gentleman, writing recently in a scientific
weekly, goes into ecstasies of admiration over the advantages and
beauty of a steel mastodon on Park Row, a building that has the
proportions of a carpenter&rsquo;s plane stood on end, decorated
here and there with balconies and a colonnade perched on brackets
up toward its fifteenth story.&nbsp; He complacently gives us its
weight and height as compared with the pyramids, and numerous
other details as to floor space and ventilation, and hints in
conclusion that only old fogies and dullards, unable to keep pace
with the times, fail to appreciate the charm of such structures
in a city.&nbsp; One of the &ldquo;points&rdquo; this writer
makes is the quality of air enjoyed by tenants, amusingly
oblivious of the fact that at least three fa&ccedil;ades of each
tall building will see the day only so long as the proprietors of
adjacent land are too poor or too busy to construct similar
colossi!</p>
<p>When all the buildings in a block are the same height, seven
eighths of the rooms in each will be without light or
ventilation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rather poor taste to brag of
advantages that are enjoyed only through the generosity of
one&rsquo;s neighbors.</p>
<p>Business demands may force us to bow before the necessity of
these horrors, but it certainly is &ldquo;rubbing it in&rdquo; to
ask our applause.&nbsp; When the Eiffel Tower was in course of
construction, the artists and literary lights of Paris raised a
tempest of protest.&nbsp; One wonders why so little of the kind
has been done here.&nbsp; It is perhaps rather late in the day to
suggest reform, yet if more New Yorkers would interest themselves
in the work, much might still be done to modify and improve our
metropolis.</p>
<p>One hears with satisfaction that a group of architects have
lately met and discussed plans for the embellishment of our
neglected city.&nbsp; There is a certain poetical justice in the
proposition coming from those who have worked so much of the
harm.&nbsp; Remorse has before now been known to produce good
results.&nbsp; The United States treasury yearly receives large
sums of &ldquo;conscience money.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 7&mdash;Worldly Color-Blindness</h2>
<p>Myriads of people have no ear for music and derive but little
pleasure from sweet sounds.&nbsp; Strange as it may appear, many
gifted and sensitive mortals have been unable to distinguish one
note from another, Apollo&rsquo;s harmonious art remaining for
them, as for the elder Dumas, only an &ldquo;expensive
noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another large class find it impossible to discriminate between
colors.&nbsp; Men afflicted in this way have even become painters
of reputation.&nbsp; I knew one of the latter, who, when a friend
complimented him on having caught the exact shade of a pink
toilet in one of his portraits, answered, &ldquo;Does that dress
look pink to you?&nbsp; I thought it was green!&rdquo; and yet he
had copied what he saw correctly.</p>
<p>Both these classes are to be pitied, but are not the cause of
much suffering to others.&nbsp; It is annoying, I grant you, to
be torn asunder in a collision, because red and green lights on
the switches combined into a pleasing harmony before the
brakeman&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The tone-deaf gentleman who insists
on whistling a popular melody is almost as trying as the lady
suffering from the same weakness, who shouts, &ldquo;Ninon,
Ninon, que fais-tu de la vie!&rdquo; until you feel impelled to
cry, &rdquo;Que faites-vous, madame, with the key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Examinations now keep daltonic gentlemen out of locomotives,
and ladies who have lost their &ldquo;keys&rdquo; are apt to find
their friends&rsquo; pianos closed.&nbsp; What we cannot guard
against is a variety of the genus <i>homo</i> which suffers from
&ldquo;social color-blindness.&rdquo;&nbsp; These well-meaning
mortals form one of the hardest trials that society is heir to;
for the disease is incurable, and as it is almost impossible to
escape from them, they continue to spread dismay and confusion
along their path to the bitter end.</p>
<p>This malady, which, as far as I know, has not been diagnosed,
invades all circles, and is, curiously enough, rampant among
well-born and apparently well-bred people.</p>
<p>Why is it that the entertainments at certain houses are always
dull failures, while across the way one enjoys such agreeable
evenings?&nbsp; Both hosts are gentlemen, enjoying about the same
amount of &ldquo;unearned increment,&rdquo; yet the atmosphere of
their houses is radically different.&nbsp; This contrast cannot
be traced to the dulness or brilliancy of the entertainer and his
wife.&nbsp; Neither can it be laid at the door of inexperience,
for the worst offenders are often old hands at the game.</p>
<p>The only explanation possible is that the owners of houses
where one is bored are socially color-blind, as cheerfully
unconscious of their weakness as the keyless lady and the
whistling abomination.</p>
<p>Since increasing wealth has made entertaining general and
lavish, this malady has become more and more apparent, until one
is tempted to parody Mme. Roland&rsquo;s dying exclamation and
cry, &ldquo;Hospitality! hospitility! what crimes are committed
in thy name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entertaining is for many people but an excuse for
ostentation.&nbsp; For others it is a means to an end; while a
third variety apparently keep a debit and credit account with
their acquaintances&mdash;in books of double entry, so that no
errors may occur&mdash;and issue invitations like receipts, only
in return for value received.</p>
<p>We can rarely tell what is passing in the minds of people
about us.&nbsp; Some of those mentioned above may feel a vague
pleasure when their rooms are filled with a chattering crowd of
more or less well-assorted guests; if that is denied them, can
find consolation for the outlay in an indefinite sensation of
having performed a duty,&mdash;what duty, or to whom, they would,
however, find it difficult to define.</p>
<p>Let the novice flee from the allurements of such a host.&nbsp;
Old hands know him and have got him on their list, escaping when
escape is possible; for he will mate the green youth with the red
frump, or like a premature millennium force the lion and the lamb
to lie down together, and imagine he has given unmixed pleasure
to both.</p>
<p>One would expect that great worldly lights might learn by
experience how fatal bungled entertainments can be, but such is
not the case.&nbsp; Many well-intentioned people continue
sacrificing their friends on the altar of hospitality year after
year with never a qualm of conscience or a sensation of pity for
their victims.&nbsp; One practical lady of my acquaintance asks
her guests alphabetically, commencing the season and the first
leaf of her visiting list simultaneously and working steadily on
through both to &ldquo;finis.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you are an A, you
will meet only A&rsquo;s at her table, with perhaps one or two
B&rsquo;s thrown in to fill up; you may sit next to your
mother-in-law for all the hostess cares.&nbsp; She has probably
never heard that the number of guests at table should not exceed
that of the muses; or if by any chance she has heard it, does not
care, and considers such a rule old-fashioned and not appropriate
to our improved modern methods of entertaining.</p>
<p>One wonders what possible satisfaction a host can derive from
providing fifty people with unwholesome food and drink at a fixed
date.&nbsp; It is a physical impossibility for him to have more
than a passing word with his guests, and ten to one the
unaccustomed number has upset the internal arrangements of his
household, so that the dinner will, in consequence, be poor and
the service defective.</p>
<p>A side-light on this question came to me recently when an
exceedingly frank husband confided to a circle of his friends at
the club the scheme his wife, who, though on pleasure bent, was
of a frugal mind, had adopted to balance her social ledger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we dine out constantly through the year,&rdquo;
remarked Benedict, &ldquo;some return is necessary.&nbsp; So we
wait until the height of the winter season, when everybody is
engaged two weeks in advance, then send out our invitations at
rather short notice for two or three consecutive dinners.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d be surprised,&rdquo; he remarked, with a beaming
smile, &ldquo;what a number refuse; last winter we cancelled all
our obligations with two dinners, the flowers and entr&eacute;es
being as fresh on the second evening as the first!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; he remarked in conclusion,
&ldquo;how simple entertaining becomes when one knows
how!&rdquo;&nbsp; Which reminded me of an ingenious youth I once
heard telling some friends how easy he had found it to write the
book he had just published.&nbsp; After his departure we agreed
that if he found it so easy it would not be worth our while to
read his volume.</p>
<p>Tender-hearted people generally make bad hosts.&nbsp; They
have a way of collecting the morally lame, halt, and blind into
their drawing-rooms that gives those apartments the air of a
convalescent home.&nbsp; The moment a couple have placed
themselves beyond the social pale, these purblind hosts conceive
an affection for and lavish hospitality upon them.&nbsp; If such
a host has been fortunate enough to get together a circle of
healthy people, you may feel confident that at the last moment a
leper will be introduced.&nbsp; This class of entertainers fail
to see that society cannot he run on a philanthropic basis, and
so insist on turning their salons into hospitals.</p>
<p>It would take too long to enumerate the thousand
idiosyncrasies of the color-blind; few, however, are more amusing
than those of the impulsive gentlemen who invite people to their
homes indiscriminately, because they happen to feel in a good
humor or chance to be seated next them at another
house,&mdash;invitations which the host regrets half an hour
later, and would willingly recall.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
think why I asked the So-and-sos!&rdquo; he will confide to
you.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t abide them; they are as dull as
the dropsy!&rdquo;&nbsp; Many years ago in Paris, we used to call
a certain hospitable lady&rsquo;s invitations &ldquo;soup
tickets,&rdquo; so little individuality did they possess.</p>
<p>The subtle laws of moral precedence are difficult reading for
the most intelligent, and therefore remain sealed books to the
afflicted mortals mentioned here.&nbsp; The delicate tact that,
with no apparent effort, combines congenial elements into a
delightful whole is lacking in their composition.&nbsp; The nice
discrimination that presides over some households is replaced by
a jovial indifference to other persons&rsquo; feelings and
prejudices.</p>
<p>The idea of placing pretty Miss D&eacute;butante next young
Strongboys instead of giving her over into the clutches of old
Mr. Boremore will never enter these obtuse entertainers&rsquo;
heads, any more than that of trying to keep poor, defenceless
Mrs. Mouse out of young Tom Cat&rsquo;s claws.</p>
<p>It is useless to enumerate instances; people have suffered too
severely at the hands of careless and incompetent hosts not to
know pretty well what the title of this paper means.&nbsp; So
many of us have come away from fruitless evenings, grinding our
teeth, and vowing never to enter those doors again while life
lasts, that the time seems ripe for a protest.</p>
<p>If the color-blind would only refrain from painting, and the
tone-deaf not insist on inviting one to their concerts, the world
would be a much more agreeable place.&nbsp; If people would only
learn what they can and what they can&rsquo;t do, and leave the
latter feats alone, a vast amount of unnecessary annoyance would
be avoided and the tiresome old grindstone turn to a more
cheerful tune.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 8&mdash;Idling in Mid-Ocean</h2>
<p>To those fortunate mortals from whom Poseidon exacts no
tribute in crossing his broad domain, a transatlantic voyage must
afford each year an ever new delight.&nbsp; The cares and worries
of existence fade away and disappear in company with the land, in
the deep bosom of the ocean buried.&nbsp; One no longer feels
like the bored mortal who has all winter turned the millstone of
work and pleasure, but seems to have transmigrated into a new
body, endowed with a ravenous appetite and perfectly fresh
sensations.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is only the novelty of the surroundings; but as I
lie somnolent in my chair, tucked into a corner of the white
deck, watching the jade-colored water rush past below, and the
sea-gulls circle gayly overhead, the <i>summum bonum</i> of
earthly contentment seems attained.&nbsp; The book chosen with
care remains uncut; the sense of physical and mental rest is too
exquisite to be broken by any effort, even the reading of a
favorite author.</p>
<p>Drowsy lapses into unconsciousness obscure the senses, like
the transparent clouds that from time to time dim the
sunlight.&nbsp; A distant bell in the wheel-house chimes the lazy
half-hours.&nbsp; Groups of people come and go like figures on a
lantern-slide.&nbsp; A curiously detached reeling makes the scene
and the actors in it as unreal as a painted ship manned by a
shadowy crew.&nbsp; The inevitable child tumbles on its face and
is picked up shrieking by tender parents; energetic youths
organize games of skill or discover whales on the horizon,
without disturbing one&rsquo;s philosophic calm.</p>
<p>I congratulate myself on having chosen a foreign line.&nbsp;
For a week at least no familiar name will be spoken, no
accustomed face appear.&nbsp; The galling harness of routine is
loosened; one breathes freely again conscious of the unoccupied
hours in perspective.</p>
<p>The welcome summons to luncheon comes as a pleasant
shock.&nbsp; Is it possible that the morning has passed?&nbsp; It
seems to have but commenced.&nbsp; I rouse myself and descend to
the cabin.&nbsp; Toward the end of the meal a rubicund Frenchman
opposite makes the startling proposition that if I wish to send a
message home he will undertake to have it delivered.&nbsp; It is
not until I notice the little square of oiled paper he is holding
out to me that I understand this reference to the &ldquo;pigeon
post&rdquo; with which the Compagnie Transatlantique is
experimenting.&nbsp; At the invitation of this new acquaintance I
ascend to the upper deck and watch his birds depart.</p>
<p>The tiny bits of paper on which we have written (post-card
fashion) message and address are rolled two or three together,
and inserted into a piece of quill less than two inches long,
which, however, they do not entirely fill.&nbsp; While a pigeon
is held by one man, another pushes one of the bird&rsquo;s
tail-feathers well through the quill, which is then fastened in
its place by two minute wooden wedges.&nbsp; A moment later the
pigeon is tossed up into the air, and we witness the working of
that mysterious instinct which all our modern science leaves
unexplained.&nbsp; After a turn or two far up in the clear sky,
the bird gets its bearings and darts off on its five-hundred-mile
journey across unknown seas to an unseen land&mdash;a voyage that
no deviation or loitering will lengthen, and only fatigue or
accident interrupt, until he alights at his cote.</p>
<p>Five of these willing messengers were started the first day
out, and five more will leave to-morrow, poor little a&euml;rial
postmen, almost predestined to destruction (in the latter case),
for we shall then be so far from land that their one chance of
life and home must depend on finding some friendly mast where an
hour&rsquo;s rest may be taken before the bird starts again on
his journey.</p>
<p>In two or three days, according to the weather, we shall begin
sending French pigeons on ahead of us toward Havre.&nbsp; The
gentleman in charge of them tells me that his wife received all
the messages he sent to her during his westward trip, the birds
appearing each morning at her window (where she was in the habit
feeding them) with their tidings from mid-ocean.&nbsp; He also
tells me that the French fleet in the Mediterranean recently
received messages from their comrades in the Baltic on the third
day by these feathered envoys.</p>
<p>It is hoped that in future ocean steamers will be able to keep
up communication with the land at least four out of the seven
days of their trips, so that, in case of delay or accident, their
exact position and circumstances can be made known at
headquarters.&nbsp; It is a pity, the originator of the scheme
remarked, that sea-gulls are such hopeless vagabonds, for they
can fly much greater distances than pigeons, and are not affected
by dampness, which seriously cripples the present messengers.</p>
<p>Later in the day a compatriot, inspired doubtless by the
morning&rsquo;s experiment, confided to me that he had hit on
&ldquo;a great scheme,&rdquo; which he intends to develop on
arriving.&nbsp; His idea is to domesticate families of porpoises
at Havre and New York, as that fish passes for having (like the
pigeon) the homing instinct.&nbsp; Ships provided with the parent
fish can free one every twenty-four hours, charged with the
morning&rsquo;s mail.&nbsp; The inventor of this luminous idea
has already designed the letter-boxes that are to be strapped on
the fishes&rsquo; backs, and decided on a neat uniform for his
postmen.</p>
<p>It is amusing during the first days &ldquo;out&rdquo; to watch
the people whom chance has thrown together into such close
quarters.&nbsp; The occult power that impels a pigeon to seek its
kind is feeble in comparison with the faculty that travellers
develop under these circumstances for seeking out congenial
spirits.&nbsp; Twelve hours do not pass before affinities draw
together; what was apparently a homogeneous mass has by that time
grouped and arranged itself into three or four distinct
circles.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;sporty&rdquo; gentlemen in loud clothes have united
in the bonds of friendship with the travelling agents and have
chosen the smoking-room as their headquarters.&nbsp; No mellow
sunset or serene moonlight will tempt these comrades from the
subtleties of poker; the pool on the run is the event of their
day.</p>
<p>A portly prima donna is the centre of another circle.&nbsp;
Her wraps, her dogs, her admirers, and her brand-new husband (a
handsome young Hungarian with a voice like two Bacian bulls) fill
the sitting-room, where the piano gets but little rest.&nbsp;
Neither sunshine nor soft winds can draw them to the deck.&nbsp;
Although too ill for the regular meals, this group eat and drink
during fifteen out of the twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The deck, however, is not deserted; two fashionable
dressmakers revel there.&nbsp; These sociable ladies asked the
<i>commissaire</i> at the start &ldquo;to introduce all the young
unmarried men to them,&rdquo; as they wanted to be jolly.&nbsp;
They have a numerous court around them, and champagne, like the
conversation, flows freely.&nbsp; These ladies have already
become expert at shuffleboard, but their &ldquo;sea legs&ldquo;
are not so good as might be expected, and the dames require to be
caught and supported by their admirers at each moment to prevent
them from tripping&mdash;an immense joke, to judge by the peals
of laughter that follow.</p>
<p>The American wife of a French ambassador sits on the
captain&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; A turn of the diplomatic wheel is
taking the lady to Madrid, where her position will call for
supreme tact and self-restraint.&nbsp; One feels a thrill of
national pride on looking at her high-bred young face and
listening as she chats in French and Spanish, and wonders once
more at the marvellous faculty our women have of adapting
themselves so graciously and so naturally to difficult positions,
which the women of other nations rarely fill well unless born to
the purple.&nbsp; It is the high opinion I have of my
countrywomen that has made me cavil, before now, on seeing them
turned into elaborately dressed nullities by foolish and too
adoring husbands.</p>
<p>The voyage is wearing itself away.&nbsp; Sunny days are
succeeded by gray mornings, as exquisite in their way, when one
can feel the ship fight against contending wind and wave, and
shiver under the blows received in a struggle which dashes the
salt spray high over the decks.&nbsp; There is an aroma in the
air then that breathes new life into jaded nerves, and stirs the
drop of old Norse blood, dormant in most American veins, into
quivering ecstasy.&nbsp; One dreams of throwing off the trammels
of civilized existence and returning to the free life of older
days.</p>
<p>But here is Havre glittering in the distance against her
background of chalk cliffs.&nbsp; People come on deck in
strangely conventional clothes and with demure citified
airs.&nbsp; Passengers of whose existence you were unaware
suddenly make their appearance.&nbsp; Two friends meet near me
for the first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hallo, Jones!&rdquo; says one of
them, &ldquo;are you crossing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answers Jones, &ldquo;are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s tug has come alongside by this time,
bringing its budget of letters and telegrams.&nbsp; The brief
holiday is over.&nbsp; With a sigh one comes back to the positive
and the present, and patiently resumes the harness of life.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 9&mdash;&ldquo;Climbers&rdquo; in England</h2>
<p>The expression &ldquo;Little Englander,&rdquo; much used of
late to designate an inhabitant of the Mother Isle in
contra-distinction to other subjects of Her Majesty, expresses
neatly the feeling of our insular cousins not only as regards
ourselves, but also the position affected toward their colonial
brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that in every circle there is some
individual assuming to do things better than his
comrades&mdash;to know more, dress better, run faster, pronounce
more correctly?&nbsp; Who, unless promptly suppressed, will turn
the conversation into a monologue relating to his own exploits
and opinions.&nbsp; To differ is to bring down his contempt upon
your devoted head!&nbsp; To argue is time wasted!</p>
<p>Human nature is, however, so constituted that a man of this
type mostly succeeds in hypnotizing his hearers into sharing his
estimate of himself, and impressing upon them the conviction that
he is a rare being instead of a commonplace mortal.&nbsp; He is
not a bad sort of person at bottom, and ready to do one a
friendly turn&mdash;if it does not entail too great
inconvenience.&nbsp; In short, a good fellow, whose principal
defect is the profound conviction that he was born superior to
the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>What this individual is to his environment, Englishmen are to
the world at large.&nbsp; It is the misfortune, not the fault, of
the rest of the human race, that they are not native to his
island; a fact, by the way, which outsiders are rarely allowed to
lose sight of, as it entails a becoming modesty on their
part.</p>
<p>Few idiosyncrasies get more quickly on American nerves or are
further from our hearty attitude toward strangers.&nbsp; As we
are far from looking upon wandering Englishmen with suspicion, it
takes us some time to realize that Americans who cut away from
their countrymen and settle far from home are regarded with
distrust and reluctantly received.&nbsp; When a family of this
kind prepares to live in their neighborhood, Britons have a
formula of three questions they ask themselves concerning the
new-comers: &ldquo;Whom do they know?&nbsp; How much are they
worth?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What amusement (or profit) are we likely
to get out of them?&rdquo;&nbsp; If the answer to all or any of
the three queries is satisfactory, my lord makes the necessary
advances and becomes an agreeable, if not a witty or original,
companion.</p>
<p>Given this and a number of other peculiarities, it seems
curious that a certain class of Americans should be so anxious to
live in England.&nbsp; What is it tempts them?&nbsp; It cannot be
the climate, for that is vile; nor the city of London, for it is
one of the ugliest in existence; nor their
&ldquo;cuisine&rdquo;&mdash;for although we are not good cooks
ourselves, we know what good food is and could give Britons
points.&nbsp; Neither can it be art, nor the opera,&mdash;one
finds both better at home or on the Continent than in
England.&nbsp; So it must be society, and here one&rsquo;s wonder
deepens!</p>
<p>When I hear friends just back from a stay over there enlarging
on the charms of &ldquo;country life,&rdquo; or a London
&ldquo;season,&rdquo; I look attentively to see if they are in
earnest, so incomparably dull have I always found English house
parties or town entertainments.&nbsp; At least that side of
society which the climbing stranger mostly affects.&nbsp; Other
circles are charming, if a bit slow, and the
&ldquo;Bohemia&rdquo; and semi-Bohemia of London have a delicate
flavor of their own.</p>
<p>County society, that ideal life so attractive to American
readers of British novels, is, taken on the whole, the most
insipid existence conceivable.&nbsp; The women lack the sparkle
and charm of ours; the men, who are out all day shooting or
hunting according to the season, get back so fagged that if they
do not actually drop asleep at the dinner-table, they will nap
immediately after, brightening only when the ladies have retired,
when, with evening dress changed for comfortable smoking suits,
the hunters congregate in the billiard-room for cigars and brandy
and seltzer.</p>
<p>A particularly agreeable American woman, whose husband insists
on going every winter to Melton-Mowbray for the hunting, was
describing the other day the life there among the women, and
expressing her wonder that those who did not hunt could refrain
from blowing out their brains, so awful was the dulness and
monotony!&nbsp; She had ended by not dining out at all, having
discovered that the conversation never by any chance deviated far
from the knees of the horses and the height of the hedges!</p>
<p>Which reminds one of Thackeray relating how he had longed to
know what women talked about when they were alone after dinner,
imagining it to be on mysterious and thrilling subjects, until
one evening he overheard such a conversation and found it turned
entirely on children and ailments!&nbsp; As regards wit, the
English are like the Oriental potentate who at a ball in Europe
expressed his astonishment that the guests took the trouble to
dance and get themselves hot and dishevelled, explaining that in
the East he paid people to do that for him.&nbsp; In England
&ldquo;amusers&rdquo; are invited expressly to be funny; anything
uttered by one of these delightful individuals is sure to be
received with much laughter.&nbsp; It is so simple that
way!&nbsp; One is prepared and knows when to laugh.&nbsp; Whereas
amateur wit is confusing.&nbsp; When an American I knew, turning
over the books on a drawing-room table and finding Hare&rsquo;s
<i>Walks in London</i>, in two volumes, said, &ldquo;So you part
your hair in the middle over here,&rdquo; the remark was received
in silence, and with looks of polite surprise.</p>
<p>It is not necessary, however, to accumulate proofs that this
much described society is less intelligent than our own.&nbsp;
Their authors have acknowledged it, and well they may.&nbsp; For
from Scott and Dickens down to Hall Caine, American appreciation
has gone far toward establishing the reputation of English
writers at home.</p>
<p>In spite of lack of humor and a thousand other defects which
ought to make English swelldom antagonistic to our countrymen,
the fact remains that &ldquo;smart&rdquo; London tempts a certain
number of Americans and has become a promised land, toward which
they turn longing eyes.&nbsp; You will always find a few of these
votaries over there in the &ldquo;season,&rdquo; struggling
bravely up the social current, making acquaintances, spending
money at charity sales, giving dinners and f&ecirc;tes, taking
houses at Ascot and filling them with their new friends&rsquo;
friends.&nbsp; With more or less success as the new-comers have
been able to return satisfactory answers to the three primary
questions.</p>
<p>What Americans are these, who force us to blush for them
infinitely more than for the unlettered tourists trotting
conscientiously around the country, doing the sights and asking
for soda-water and buckwheat cakes at the hotels!</p>
<p>Any one who has been an observer of the genus
&ldquo;Climber&rdquo; at home, and wondered at their way and
courage, will recognize these ambitious souls abroad; five
minutes&rsquo; conversation is enough.&nbsp; It is never about a
place that they talk, but of the people they know.&nbsp; London
to them is not the city of Dickens.&nbsp; It is a place where one
may meet the Prince of Wales and perhaps obtain an entrance into
his set.</p>
<p>One description will cover most climbers.&nbsp; They are, as a
rule, people who start humbly in some small city, then when
fortune comes, push on to New York and Newport, where they carry
all before them and make their houses centres and themselves
powers.&nbsp; Next comes the discovery that the circle into which
they have forced their way is not nearly as attractive as it
appeared from a distance.&nbsp; Consequently that vague
disappointment is felt which most of us experience on attaining a
long desired goal&mdash;the unsatisfactoriness of success!&nbsp;
Much the same sensation as caused poor Du Maurier to answer, when
asked shortly before his death why he looked so glum,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m soured by success!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So true is this of all human nature that the following recipe
might be given for the attainment of perfect happiness:
&ldquo;Begin far down in any walk of life.&nbsp; Rise by your
efforts higher each year, and then be careful to die before
discovering that there is nothing at the top.&nbsp; The
excitement of the struggle&mdash;&lsquo;the rapture of the
chase&rsquo;&mdash;are greater joys than achievement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our ambitious friends naturally ignore this bit of
philosophy.&nbsp; When it is discovered that the
&ldquo;world&rdquo; at home has given but an unsatisfactory
return for cash and conniving, it occurs to them that the fault
lies in the circle, and they assume that their particular talents
require a larger field.&nbsp; Having conquered all in sight,
these social Alexanders pine for a new world, which generally
turns out to be the &ldquo;Old,&rdquo; so a crossing is made, and
the &ldquo;Conquest of England&rdquo; begun with all the
enthusiasm and push employed on starting out from the little
native city twenty years before.</p>
<p>It is in Victoria&rsquo;s realm that foemen worthy of their
steel await the conquerors.&nbsp; Home society was a too easy
prey, opening its doors and laying down its arms at the first
summons.&nbsp; In England the new-comers find that their little
game has been played before; and, well, what they imagined was a
discovery proves to be a long-studied science with
&ldquo;<i>donnant</i>! <i>donnant</i>!&rdquo; as its fundamental
law.&nbsp; Wily opponents with trump cards in their hands and a
profound knowledge of &ldquo;Hoyle&rdquo; smilingly offer them
seats.&nbsp; Having acquired in a home game a knowledge of
&ldquo;bluff,&rdquo; our friends plunge with delight into the
fray, only to find English society so formed that, climb they
never so wisely, the top can never be reached.&nbsp; Work as hard
as they may, succeed even beyond their fondest hopes, there will
always remain circles above, toward which to yearn&mdash;people
who will refuse to know them, houses they will never be invited
to enter.&nbsp; Think of the charm, the attraction such a
civilization must have for the real born climber, and you, my
reader, will understand why certain of our compatriots enjoy
living in England, and why when once the intoxicating draught
(supplied to the ambitious on the other side) has been tasted,
all home concoctions prove insipid.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 10&mdash;<i>Calv&eacute;</i> at Cabri&egrave;res</h2>
<p>While I was making a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; last year at Lamalou,
an obscure Spa in the Cevennes Mountains, Madame Calv&eacute;, to
whom I had expressed a desire to see her picturesque home,
telegraphed an invitation to pass the day with her, naming the
train she could meet, which would allow for the long drive to her
ch&acirc;teau before luncheon.&nbsp; It is needless to say the
invitation was accepted.&nbsp; As my train drew up at the little
station, Madame Calv&eacute;, in her trap, was the first person I
saw, and no time was lost in getting <i>en route</i>.</p>
<p>During the hour passed on the poplar-bordered road that leads
straight and white across the country I had time to appreciate
the transformation in the woman at my side.&nbsp; Was this
gray-clad, nunlike figure the passionate, sensuous Carmen of
Bizet&rsquo;s masterpiece?&nbsp; Could that calm, pale face,
crossed by innumerable lines of suffering, as a spider&rsquo;s
web lies on a flower, blaze and pant with Sappho&rsquo;s guilty
love?</p>
<p>Something of these thoughts must have appeared on my face, for
turning with a smile, she asked, &ldquo;You find me
changed?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the air of my village.&nbsp; Here
I&rsquo;m myself.&nbsp; Everywhere else I&rsquo;m
different.&nbsp; On the stage I am any part I may be playing, but
am never really happy away from my hill there.&rdquo;&nbsp; As
she spoke, a sun-baked hamlet came in sight, huddled around the
base of two tall towers that rose cool and gray in the noonday
heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that wing,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;is arranged for
the convalescent girls whom I have sent down to me from the Paris
hospitals for a cure of fresh air and simple food.&nbsp; Six
years ago, just after I had bought this place, a series of
operations became necessary which left me prostrated and
an&aelig;mic.&nbsp; No tonics were of benefit.&nbsp; I grew
weaker day by day, until the doctors began to despair of my
life.&nbsp; Finally, at the advice of an old woman here who
passes for being something of a curer, I tried the experiment or
lying five or six hours a day motionless in the sunlight.&nbsp;
It wasn&rsquo;t long before I felt life creeping back to my poor
feeble body.&nbsp; The hot sun of our magic south was a more
subtle tonic than any drug.&nbsp; When the cure was complete, I
made up my mind that each summer the same chance should be
offered to as many of my suffering sisters as this old place
could be made to accommodate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bells on the shaggy Tarbes ponies she was driving along
the Languedoc road drew, on nearing her residence, a number of
peasant children from their play.</p>
<p>As the ruddy urchins ran shouting around our carriage wheels
and scrambled in the dust for the sous we threw them, my hostess
pointed laughing to a scrubby little girl with tomato-colored
cheeks and tousled dark hair, remarking, &ldquo;I looked like
that twenty years ago and performed just those antics on this
very road.&nbsp; No punishment would keep me off the
highway.&nbsp; Those pennies, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, will all
be spent at the village pastry cook&rsquo;s within an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said with such a tender glance at the children that
one realized the great artist was at home here, surrounded by the
people she loved and understood.&nbsp; True to the
&ldquo;homing&rdquo; instinct of the French peasant, Madame
Calv&eacute;, when fortune came to her, bought and partially
restored the rambling ch&acirc;teau which at sunset casts its
shadow across the village of her birth.&nbsp; Since that day
every moment of freedom from professional labor and every penny
of her large income are spent at Cabri&egrave;res, building,
planning, even farming, when her health permits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she continued, as we approached the
ch&acirc;teau, &ldquo;that the happiest day of my life&mdash;and
I have, as you know, passed some hours worth living, both on and
off the stage&mdash;was when, that wing completed, a Paris train
brought the first occupants for my twenty little bedrooms; no
words can tell the delight it gives me now to see the color
coming back to my patients&rsquo; pale lips and hear them
laughing and singing about the place.&nbsp; As I am always short
of funds, the idea of abandoning this work is the only fear the
future holds for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the vivacity peculiar to her character, my companion then
whipped up her cobs and turned the conversation into gayer
channels.&nbsp; Five minutes later we clattered over a drawbridge
and drew up in a roomy courtyard, half blinding sunlight and half
blue shadow, where a score of girls were occupied with books and
sewing.</p>
<p>The luncheon bell was ringing as we ascended the terrace
steps.&nbsp; After a hurried five minutes for brushing and
washing, we took our places at a long table set in the cool stone
hall, guests stopping in the ch&acirc;teau occupying one end
around the chatelaine, the convalescents filling the other
seats.</p>
<p>Those who have only seen the capricious diva on the stage or
in Parisian salons can form little idea of the proprietress of
Cabri&egrave;res.&nbsp; No shade of coquetry blurs the clear
picture of her home life.&nbsp; The capped and saboted peasant
women who waited on us were not more simple in their ways.&nbsp;
Several times during the meal she left her seat to inquire after
the comfort of some invalid girl or inspect the cooking in the
adjacent kitchen.&nbsp; These wanderings were not, however,
allowed to disturb the conversation, which flowed on after the
mellow French fashion, enlivened by much wit and gay
badinage.&nbsp; One of our hostess&rsquo;s anecdotes at her own
expense was especially amusing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When in Venice,&rdquo; she told us, &ldquo;most prima
donnas are carried to and from the opera in sedan chairs to avoid
the risk of colds from the draughty gondolas.&nbsp; The last
night of my initial season there, I was informed, as the curtain
fell, that a number of Venetian nobles were planning to carry me
in triumph to the hotel.&nbsp; When I descended from my
dressing-room the courtyard of the theatre was filled with men in
dress clothes, bearing lanterns, who caught up the chair as soon
as I was seated and carried it noisily across the city to the
hotel.&nbsp; Much moved by this unusual honor, I mounted to the
balcony of my room, from which elevation I bowed my thanks, and
threw all the flowers at hand to my escort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning the hotel proprietor appeared with my
coffee, and after hesitating a moment, remarked: &lsquo;Well, we
made a success of it last night.&nbsp; It has been telegraphed to
all the capitals of Europe!&nbsp; I hope you will not think a
thousand francs too much, considering the
advertisement!&rsquo;&nbsp; In blank amazement, I asked what he
meant.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mean the triumphal progress,&rsquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought you understood!&nbsp; We always
organize one for the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; who visit Venice.&nbsp;
The men who carried your chair last night were the waiters from
the hotels.&nbsp; We hire them on account of their dress
clothes&rsquo;!&nbsp; Think of the disillusion,&rdquo; added
Calv&eacute;, laughing, &ldquo;and my disgust, when I thought of
myself na&iuml;vely throwing kisses and flowers to a group of
Swiss gar&ccedil;ons at fifteen francs a head.&nbsp; There was
nothing to do, however, but pay the bill and swallow my
chagrin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many pretty women do you suppose would tell such a joke
upon themselves?&nbsp; Another story she told us is
characteristic of her peasant neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came back here after my first season in St.
Petersburg and London the <i>cur&eacute;</i> requested me to sing
at our local f&ecirc;te.&nbsp; I gladly consented, and, standing
by his side on the steps of the <i>Mairie</i>, gave the great
aria from the <i>Huguenots</i> in my best manner.&nbsp; To my
astonishment the performance was received in complete
silence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Calv&eacute;,&rsquo; I heard an old
friend of my mother&rsquo;s murmur.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her voice used
to be so nice, and now it&rsquo;s all gone!&rsquo;&nbsp; Taking
in the situation at a glance, I threw my voice well up into my
nose and started off on a well-known provincial song, in the
shrill falsetto of our peasant women.&nbsp; The effect was
instantaneous!&nbsp; Long before the end the performance was
drowned in thunders of applause.&nbsp; Which proves that to be
popular a singer must adapt herself to her audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luncheon over, we repaired for cigarettes and coffee to an
upper room, where Calv&eacute; was giving Dagnan-Bouveret some
sittings for a portrait, and lingered there until four
o&rsquo;clock, when our hostess left us for her siesta, and a
&ldquo;break&rdquo; took those who cared for the excursion across
the valley to inspect the ruins of a Roman bath.&nbsp; A late
dinner brought us together again in a small dining room, the
convalescents having eaten their simple meal and disappeared an
hour before.&nbsp; During this time, another transformation had
taken place in our mercurial hostess!&nbsp; It was the
Calv&eacute; of Paris, Calv&eacute; the witch, Calv&eacute; the
<i>capiteuse</i>, who presided at the dainty, flower-decked table
and led the laughing conversation.</p>
<p>A few notes struck on a guitar by one of the party, as we sat
an hour later on the moonlit terrace, were enough to start off
the versatile artist, who was in her gayest humor.&nbsp; She sang
us stray bits of opera, alternating her music with scenes
burlesqued from recent plays.&nbsp; No one escaped her inimitable
mimicry, not even the &ldquo;divine Sarah,&rdquo; Calv&eacute;
giving us an unpayable impersonation of the elderly
<i>trag&eacute;dienne</i> as Lorenzaccio, the boy hero of Alfred
de Musset&rsquo;s drama.&nbsp; Burlesquing led to her dancing
some Spanish steps with an abandon never attempted on the
stage!&nbsp; Which in turn gave place to an imitation of an
American whistling an air from <i>Carmen</i>, and some
&ldquo;coon songs&rdquo; she had picked up during her stay at New
York.&nbsp; They, again, were succeeded by a superb rendering of
the imprecation from Racine&rsquo;s <i>Camille</i>, which made
her audience realize that in gaining a soprano the world has
lost, perhaps, its greatest <i>trag&eacute;dienne</i>.</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock the clatter of hoofs in the court
warned us that the pleasant evening had come to an end.&nbsp; A
journalist <i>en route</i> for Paris was soon installed with me
in the little omnibus that was to take us to the station,
Calv&eacute; herself lighting our cigars and providing the wraps
that were to keep out the cool night air.</p>
<p>As we passed under the low archway of the entrance amid a
clamor of &ldquo;adieu&ldquo; and &ldquo;au revoir,&rdquo; the
young Frenchman at my side pointed up to a row of closed windows
overhead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a lesson,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;for all of us, to think of the occupants of those little
rooms, whom the generosity and care of that gracious artist are
leaning by such pleasant paths back to health and courage for
their toilsome lives?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 11&mdash;A Cry For Fresh Air</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; reads the familiar nursery
tale, while the fairies, invited by a king and queen to the
christening of their daughter, were showering good gifts on the
baby princess, a disgruntled old witch, whom no one had thought
of asking to the ceremony, appeared uninvited on the scene and
revenged herself by decreeing that the presents of the good
fairies, instead of proving beneficial, should bring only trouble
and embarrassment to the royal infant.</p>
<p>A telling analogy might be drawn between that unhappy princess
over whose fate so many youthful tears have been shed, and the
condition of our invention-ridden country; for we see every day
how the good gifts of those nineteenth century fairies, Science
and Industry, instead of proving blessings to mankind, are being
turned by ignorance and stupidity into veritable afflictions.</p>
<p>If a prophetic gentleman had told Louis Fourteenth&rsquo;s
shivering courtiers&mdash;whom an iron etiquette forced on winter
mornings into the (appropriately named) Galerie des Glaces,
stamping their silk-clad feet and blowing on their blue fingers,
until the king should appear&mdash;that within a century and a
half one simple discovery would enable all classes of people to
keep their shops and dwellings at a summer temperature through
the severest winters, the half-frozen nobles would have flouted
the suggestion as an &ldquo;iridescent dream,&rdquo; a sort of
too-good-to-be-true prophecy.</p>
<p>What was to those noblemen an unheard-of luxury has become
within the last decade one of the primary necessities of our
life.</p>
<p>The question arises now: Are we gainers by the change?&nbsp;
Has the indiscriminate use of heat been of advantage, either
mentally or physically, to the nation?</p>
<p>The incubus of caloric that sits on our gasping country is
particularly painful at this season, when nature undertakes to do
her own heating.</p>
<p>In other less-favored lands, the first spring days, the
exquisite awakening of the world after a long winter, bring to
the inhabitants a sensation of joy and renewed vitality.&nbsp;
We, however, have discounted that enjoyment.&nbsp; Delicate
gradations of temperature are lost on people who have been
stewing for six months in a mixture of steam and twice-breathed
air.</p>
<p>What pleasure can an early April day afford the man who has
slept in an overheated flat and is hurrying to an office where
eighty degrees is the average all the year round?&nbsp; Or the
pale shop-girl, who complains if a breath of morning air strays
into the suburban train where she is seated?</p>
<p>As people who habitually use such &ldquo;relishes&rdquo; as
Chutney and Worcestershire are incapable of appreciating
delicately prepared food, so the &rdquo;soft&rdquo; mortals who
have accustomed themselves to a perpetual August are insensible
to fine shadings of temperature.</p>
<p>The other day I went with a friend to inspect some rooms he
had been decorating in one of our public schools.&nbsp; The
morning had been frosty, but by eleven o&rsquo;clock the sun
warmed the air uncomfortably.&nbsp; On entering the school we
were met by a blast of heated air that was positively
staggering.&nbsp; In the recitation rooms, where, as in all New
York schoolrooms, the children were packed like dominoes in a
box, the temperature could not have been under eighty-five.</p>
<p>The pale, spectacled spinster in charge, to whom we complained
of this, was astonished and offended at what she considered our
interference, and answered that &ldquo;the children liked it
warm,&rdquo; as for herself she &ldquo;had a cold and could not
think of opening a window.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the rooms were too
warm it was the janitor&rsquo;s fault, and he had gone out!</p>
<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock struck before we had finished our tour of
inspection.&nbsp; It is to be doubted if anywhere else in the
world could there be found such a procession of pasty-faced,
dull-eyed youngsters as trooped past us down the stairs.&nbsp;
Their appearance was the natural result of compelling children
dressed for winter weather to sit many hours each day in
hothouses, more suited to tropical plants than to growing human
beings.</p>
<p>A gentleman with us remarked with a sigh, &ldquo;I have been
in almost every school in the city and find the same condition
everywhere.&nbsp; It is terrible, but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to
be any remedy for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The taste for living in a
red-hot atmosphere is growing on our people; even public vehicles
have to be heated now to please the patrons.</p>
<p>When tiresome old Benjamin Franklin made stoves popular he
struck a terrible blow at the health of his compatriots; the
introduction of steam heat and consequent suppression of all
health-giving ventilation did the rest; the rosy cheeks of
American children went up the chimney with the last whiff of wood
smoke, and have never returned.&nbsp; Much of our home life
followed; no family can be expected to gather in cheerful
converse around a &ldquo;radiator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can this horror of fresh air among us be explained?&nbsp;
If people really enjoy living in overheated rooms with little or
no ventilation, why is it that we hear so much complaining, when
during the summer months the thermometer runs up into the
familiar nineties?&nbsp; Why are children hurried out of town,
and why do wives consider it a necessity to desert their
husbands?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather inconsistent, to say the least, for not one
of those deserters but would &ldquo;kick&rdquo; if the theatre or
church they attend fell below that temperature in December.</p>
<p>It is impossible to go into our banks and offices and not
realize that the air has been breathed again and again, heated
and cooled, but never changed,&mdash;doors and windows fit too
tightly for that.</p>
<p>The pallor and dazed expression of the employees tell the same
tale.&nbsp; I spoke to a youth the other day in an office about
his appearance and asked if he was ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;I have had a succession of colds all
winter.&nbsp; You see, my desk here is next to the radiator, so I
am in a perpetual perspiration and catch cold as soon as I go
out.&nbsp; Last winter I passed three months in a farmhouse,
where the water froze in my room at night, and we had to wear
overcoats to our meals.&nbsp; Yet I never had a cold there, and
gained in weight and strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty years ago no &ldquo;palatial private residence&rdquo;
was considered complete unless there was a stationary washstand
(forming a direct connection with the sewer) in each
bedroom.&nbsp; We looked pityingly on foreigners who did not
enjoy these advantages, until one day we realized that the latter
were in the right, and straightway stationary washstands
disappeared.</p>
<p>How much time must pass and how many victims be sacrificed
before we come to our senses on the great radiator question?</p>
<p>As a result of our population living in a furnace, it happens
now that when you rebel on being forced to take an impromptu
Turkish bath at a theatre, the usher answers your complaint with
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be as warm as you think, for a lady over
there has just told me she felt chilly and asked for more
heat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another invention of the enemy is the &ldquo;revolving
door.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this ingenious contrivance the little fresh
air that formerly crept into a building is now excluded.&nbsp;
Which explains why on entering our larger hotels one is taken by
the throat, as it were, by a sickening long-dead
atmosphere&mdash;in which the souvenir of past meals and decaying
flowers floats like a regret&mdash;such as explorers must find on
opening an Egyptian tomb.</p>
<p>Absurd as it may seem, it has become a distinction to have
cool rooms.&nbsp; Alas, they are rare!&nbsp; Those blessed
households where one has the delicious sensation of being chilly
and can turn with pleasure toward crackling wood!&nbsp; The open
fire has become, within the last decade, a test of refinement,
almost a question of good breeding, forming a broad distinction
between dainty households and vulgar ones, and marking the line
which separates the homes of cultivated people from the parlors
of those who care only for display.</p>
<p>A drawing-room filled with heat, the source of which remains
invisible, is as characteristic of the parvenu as clanking chains
on a harness or fine clothes worn in the street.</p>
<p>An open fire is the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; of a room, which can no
more be attractive without it than the human face can be
beautiful if it lacks the visual organs.&nbsp; The &ldquo;gas
fire&rdquo; bears about the same relation to the real thing as a
glass eye does to a natural one, and produces much the same
sensation.&nbsp; Artificial eyes are painful necessities in some
cases, and therefore cannot be condemned; but the household which
gathers complacently around a &ldquo;gas log&rdquo; must have
something radically wrong with it, and would be capable of worse
offences against taste and hospitality.</p>
<p>There is a tombstone in a New England grave-yard the
inscription on which reads: &ldquo;I was well, I wanted to be
better.&nbsp; Here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As regards heating of our houses, it&rsquo;s to be feared that
we have gone much the same road as the unfortunate New
Englander.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that he is now
suffering from too much heat, but we, as a nation, certainly
are.</p>
<p>Janitors and parlor-car conductors have replaced the wicked
fairies of other days, but are apparently animated by their
malignant spirit, and employ their hours of brief authority as
cruelly.&nbsp; No witch dancing around her boiling cauldron was
ever more joyful than the fireman of a modern hotel, as he
gleefully turns more and more steam upon his helpless
victims.&nbsp; Long acquaintance with that gentleman has
convinced me that he cannot plead ignorance as an excuse for
falling into these excesses.&nbsp; It is pure, unadulterated
perversity, else why should he invariably choose the mildest
mornings to show what his engines can do?</p>
<p>Many explanations have been offered for this love of a high
temperature by our compatriots.&nbsp; Perhaps the true one has
not yet been found.&nbsp; Is it not possible that what appears to
be folly and almost criminal negligence of the rules of health,
may be, after all, only a commendable ambition to renew the
exploits of those biblical heroes, Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 12&mdash;The Paris of our Grandparents</h2>
<p>We are apt to fall into the error of assuming that only
American cities have displaced their centres and changed their
appearance during the last half-century.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;oldest inhabitant,&rdquo; with his twice-told tales
of transformations and changes, is to a certain extent
responsible for this; by contrast, we imagine that the capitals
of Europe have always been just as we see them.&nbsp; So strong
is this impression that it requires a serious effort of the
imagination to reconstruct the Paris that our grandparents knew
and admired, few as the years are that separate their day from
ours.</p>
<p>It is, for instance, difficult to conceive of a Paris that
ended at the rue Royale, with only waste land and market gardens
beyond the Madeleine, where to-day so many avenues open their
stately perspectives; yet such was the case!&nbsp; The few fine
residences that existed beyond that point faced the Faubourg
Saint-Honor&eacute;, with gardens running back to an unkempt open
country called the Champs Elys&eacute;es, where an unfinished Arc
de Triomphe stood alone in a wilderness that no one ever dreamed
of traversing.</p>
<p>The fashionable ladies of that time drove in the afternoon
along the boulevards from the Madeleine to the Ch&acirc;teau
d&rsquo;Eau, and stopped their ponderous yellow barouches at
Tortoni&rsquo;s, where ices were served to them in their
carriages, while they chatted with immaculate dandies in
skin-tight nankeen unmentionables, blue swallow-tailed coats, and
furry &lsquo;beaver&rdquo; hats.</p>
<p>While looking over some books in the company of an old lady
who from time to time opens her store of treasures and recalls
her remote youth at my request, and whose <i>spirituel</i> and
graphic language gives to her souvenirs the air of being stray
chapters from some old-fashioned romance, I received a vivid
impression of how the French capital must have looked fifty years
ago.</p>
<p>Emptying in her company a chest of books that had not seen the
light for several decades, we came across a &ldquo;Panorama of
the Boulevards,&rdquo; dated 1845, which proved when unfolded to
be a colored lithograph, a couple of yards long by five or six
inches high, representing the line of boulevards from the
Madeleine to the Place de la Bastille.&nbsp; Each house, almost
each tree, was faithfully depicted, together with the crowds on
the sidewalks and the carriages in the street.&nbsp; The whole
scene was as different from the effect made by that thoroughfare
to-day as though five hundred and not fifty years had elapsed
since the little book was printed.&nbsp; The picture breathed an
atmosphere of calm and nameless quaintness that one finds now
only in old provincial cities which have escaped the ravages of
improvement.</p>
<p>My companion sat with the book unfolded before her, in a
smiling trance.&nbsp; Her mind had turned back to the far-away
days when she first trod those streets a bride, with all the
pleasures and few of the cares of life to think about.</p>
<p>I watched her in silence (it seemed a sacrilege to break in on
such a train of thought), until gradually her eyes lost their
far-away expression, and, turning to me with a smile, she
exclaimed: &ldquo;How we ever had the courage to appear in the
street dressed as we were is a mystery!&nbsp; Do you see that
carriage?&rdquo; pointing in the print to a high-swung family
vehicle with a powdered coachman on the box, and two sky-blue
lackeys standing behind.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can remember, as if it
were yesterday, going to drive with Lady B-, the British
ambassadress, in just such a conveyance.&nbsp; She drove four
horses with feathers on their heads, when she used to come to
Meurice&rsquo;s for me.&nbsp; I blush when I think that my frock
was so scant that I had to raise the skirt almost to my knees in
order to get into her carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why we didn&rsquo;t all die of pneumonia is another
marvel, for we wore low-necked dresses and the thinnest of
slippers in the street, our heads being about the only part that
was completely covered.&nbsp; I was particularly proud of a
turban surmounted with a bird of paradise, but Lady B--- affected
poke bonnets, then just coming into fashion, so large and so deep
that when one looked at her from the side nothing was visible
except two curls, &lsquo;as damp and as black as
leeches.&rsquo;&nbsp; In other ways our toilets were absurdly
unsuited for every-day wear; we wore light scarves over our
necks, and rarely used furlined pelisses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to an examination of the panorama, my companion
pointed out to me that there was no break in the boulevards,
where the opera-house, with its seven radiating avenues, now
stands, but a long line of H&ocirc;tels, dozing behind high
walls, and quaint two-storied buildings that undoubtedly dated
from the razing of the city wall and the opening of the new
thoroughfare under Louis XV.</p>
<p>A little farther on was the world-famous Maison Dor&eacute;e,
where one almost expected to see Alfred de Musset and le docteur
V&eacute;ron dining with Dumas and Eugene Sue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of goodness is that?&rdquo; I
exclaimed, pointing to a couple of black and yellow monstrosities
on wheels, which looked like three carriages joined together with
a &ldquo;buggy&rdquo; added on in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the diligence just arrived from Calais; it
has been two days <i>en route</i>, the passengers sleeping as
best they could, side by side, and escaping from their
confinement only when horses were changed or while stopping for
meals.&nbsp; That high two-wheeled trap with the little
&lsquo;tiger&rsquo; standing up behind is a tilbury.&nbsp; We
used to see the Count d&rsquo;Orsay driving one like that almost
every day.&nbsp; He wore butter-colored gloves, and the skirts of
his coat were pleated full all around, and stood out like a
ballet girl&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is a pity they have not included
Louis Philippe and his family jogging off to Neuilly in the court
&lsquo;carryall,&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;Citizen King,&rsquo;
with his blue umbrella between his knees, trying to look like an
honest bourgeois, and failing even in that attempt to please the
Parisians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in Paris in &rsquo;48; from my window at
Meurice&rsquo;s I saw poor old <i>Juste Milieu</i> read his
abdication from the historic middle balcony of the Tuileries, and
half an hour later we perceived the Duchesse
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans leave the Tuileries on foot, leading her
two sons by the hand, and walk through the gardens and across the
Place de la Concorde to the Corps L&eacute;gislatif, in a last
attempt to save the crown for her son.&nbsp; Futile effort!&nbsp;
That evening the &lsquo;Citizen King&rsquo; was hurried through
those same gardens and into a passing cab, <i>en route</i> for a
life exile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our balcony at Meurice&rsquo;s was a fine point of
observation from which to watch a revolution.&nbsp; With an
opera-glass we could see the mob surging to the sack of the
palace, the priceless furniture and bric-&agrave;-brac flung into
the street, court dresses waved on pikes from the tall windows,
and finally the throne brought out, and carried off to be
burned.&nbsp; There was no keeping the men of our party in after
that.&nbsp; They rushed off to have a nearer glimpse of the
fighting, and we saw no more of them until daybreak the following
morning when, just as we were preparing to send for the police,
two dilapidated, ragged, black-faced mortals appeared, in whom we
barely recognized our husbands.&nbsp; They had been impressed
into service and passed their night building barricades.&nbsp; My
better half, however, had succeeded in snatching a handful of the
gold fringe from the throne as it was carried by, an act of
prowess that repaid him for all his troubles and fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed the greater part of forty-eight hours on our
balcony, watching the mob marching by, singing <i>La
Marseillaise</i>, and camping at night in the streets.&nbsp; It
was all I could do to tear myself away from the window long
enough to eat and write in my journal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no Avenue de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra then.&nbsp;
The trip from the boulevards to the Palais-Royal had to be made
by a long detour across the Place Vend&ocirc;me (where, by the
bye, a cattle market was held) or through a labyrinth of narrow,
bad-smelling little streets, where strangers easily lost their
way.&nbsp; Next to the boulevards, the Palais-Royal was the
centre of the elegant and dissipated life in the capital.&nbsp;
It was there we met of an afternoon to drink chocolate at the
&lsquo;Rotonde,&rsquo; or to dine at &lsquo;Les Trois
Fr&egrave;res Proven&ccedil;aux,&rsquo; and let our husbands have
a try at the gambling tables in the Passage
d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one thought of buying jewelry anywhere else.&nbsp;
It was from the windows of its shops that the fashions started on
their way around the world.&nbsp; When Victoria as a bride was
visiting Louis Philippe, she was so fascinated by the aspect of
the place that the gallant French king ordered a miniature copy
of the scene, made <i>in papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;</i>, as a
present for his guest, a sort of gigantic dolls&rsquo; house in
which not only the palace and its long colonnades were
reproduced, but every tiny shop and the myriad articles for sale
were copied with Chinese fidelity.&nbsp; Unfortunately the
pear-headed old king became England&rsquo;s uninvited guest
before this clumsy toy was finished, so it never crossed the
Channel, but can be seen to-day by any one curious enough to
examine it, in the Mus&eacute;e Carnavalet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few of us realize that the Paris of Charles X. and
Louis Philippe would seem to us now a small, ill-paved, and
worse-lighted provincial town, with few theatres or hotels,
communicating with the outer world only by means of a horse-drawn
&lsquo;post,&rsquo; and practically farther from London than
Constantinople is to-day.&nbsp; One feels this isolation in the
literature of the time; brilliant as the epoch was, the horizon
of its writers was bounded by the boulevards and the Faubourg
Saint-Germain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dumas says laughingly, in a letter to a friend: &ldquo;I have
never ventured into the unexplored country beyond the Bastille,
but am convinced that it shelters wild animals and
savages.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wit and brains of the period were
concentrated into a small space.&nbsp; Money-making had no more
part in the programme of a writer then than an introduction into
&ldquo;society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catering to a foreign market and
snobbishness were undreamed-of degradations.&nbsp; Paris had not
yet been turned into the <i>Foire du Monde</i> that she has since
become, with whole quarters given over to the use of
foreigners,&mdash;theatres, restaurants, and hotels created only
for the use of a polyglot population that could give lessons to
the people around Babel&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;tower.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 13&mdash;Some American Husbands</h2>
<p>Until the beginning of this century men played the <i>beau
r&ocirc;le</i> in life&rsquo;s comedy.&nbsp; As in the rest of
the animal world, our males were the brilliant members of the
community, flaunting their gaudy plumage at home and abroad,
while the women-folk remained in seclusion, tending their
children, directing the servants, or ministering to their
lords&rsquo; comfort.</p>
<p>In those happy days the husband ruled supreme at his own
fireside, receiving the homage of the family, who bent to his
will and obeyed his orders.</p>
<p>During the last century, however, the &ldquo;part&rdquo; of
better half has become less and less attractive in America, one
prerogative after another having been whisked away by
enterprising wives.&nbsp; Modern Delilahs have yearly snipped off
more and more of Samson&rsquo;s luxuriant curls, and added those
ornaments to their own <i>coiffures</i>, until in the majority of
families the husband finds himself reduced to a state of bondage
compared with which the biblical hero enjoyed a pampered
idleness.&nbsp; Times have indeed changed in America since the
native chief sat in dignified repose bedizened with all the
finery at hand, while the ladies of the family waited tremblingly
upon him.&nbsp; To-day it is the American husband who turns the
grindstone all the year round, and it is his pretty tyrant who
enjoys the elegant leisure that a century ago was considered a
masculine luxury.</p>
<p>To America must be given the credit of having produced the
model husband, a new species, as it were, of the <i>genus
homo</i>.</p>
<p>In no r&ocirc;le does a compatriot appear to such advantage as
in that of Benedict.&nbsp; As a boy he is often too advanced for
his years or his information; in youth he is conspicuous neither
for his culture nor his unselfishness.&nbsp; But once in
matrimonial harness this untrained animal becomes bridle-wise
with surprising rapidity, and will for the rest of life go
through his paces, waltzing, kneeing, and saluting with hardly a
touch of the whip.&nbsp; Whether this is the result of superior
horse-womanship on the part of American wives or a trait peculiar
to sons of &ldquo;Uncle Sam,&rdquo; is hard to say, but the fact
is self-evident to any observer that our fair equestrians rarely
meet with a rebellious mount.</p>
<p>Any one who has studied marital ways in other lands will
realize that in no country have the men effaced themselves so
gracefully as with us.&nbsp; In this respect no foreign
production can compare for a moment with the domestic
article.&nbsp; In English, French, and German families the
husband is still all-powerful.&nbsp; The house is mounted, guests
are asked, and the year planned out to suit his occupations and
pleasure.&nbsp; Here papa is rarely consulted until such matters
have been decided upon by the ladies, when the head of the house
is called in to sign the checks.</p>
<p>I have had occasion more than once to bewail the shortcomings
of the American man, and so take pleasure in pointing out the
modesty and good temper with which he fills this role.&nbsp; He
is trained from the beginning to give all and expect nothing in
return, an American girl rarely bringing any <i>dot</i> to her
husband, no matter how wealthy her family may be.&nbsp; If, as
occasionally happens, an income is allowed a bride by her
parents, she expects to spend it on her toilets or
pleasures.&nbsp; This condition of the matrimonial market exists
in no other country; even in England, where <i>mariages de
convenance</i> are rare, &ldquo;settlements&rdquo; form an
inevitable prelude to conjugal bliss.</p>
<p>The fact that she contributes little or nothing to the common
income in no way embarrasses an American wife; her pretensions
are usually in an inverse proportion to her personal means.&nbsp;
A man I knew some years ago deliberately chose his bride from an
impecunious family (in the hope that her simple surroundings had
inculcated homely taste), and announced to an incredulous circle
of friends, at his last bachelor dinner, that he intended, in
future, to pass his evenings at his fireside, between his book
and his pretty spouse.&nbsp; Poor, innocent, confiding
mortal!&nbsp; The wife quickly became a belle of the fastest set
in town.&nbsp; Having had more than she wanted of firesides and
quiet evenings before her marriage, her idea was to go about as
much as possible, and, when not so occupied, to fill her house
with company.&nbsp; It may be laid down as a maxim in this
connection that a man marries to obtain a home, and a girl to get
away from one; hence disappointment on both sides.</p>
<p>The couple in question have in all probability not passed an
evening alone since they were married, the lady rarely stopping
in the round of her gayeties until she collapses from
fatigue.&nbsp; Their home is typical of their life, which itself
can be taken as a good example of the existence that most of our
&ldquo;smart&rdquo; people lead.&nbsp; The ground floor and the
first floor are given up to entertaining.&nbsp; The second is
occupied by the spacious sitting, bath, and sleeping rooms of the
lady.&nbsp; A ten-by-twelve chamber suffices for my lord, and the
only den he can rightly call his own is a small room near the
front door, about as private as the sidewalk, which is turned
into a cloak-room whenever the couple receive, making it
impossible to keep books or papers of value there, or even to use
it as a smoking-room after dinner, so his men guests sit around
the dismantled dining-table while the ladies are enjoying a suite
of parlors above.</p>
<p>At first the idea of such an unequal division of the house
shocks our sense of justice, until we reflect that the American
husband is not expected to remain at home.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not
his place!&nbsp; If he is not down town making money, fashion
dictates that he must be at some club-house playing a game.&nbsp;
A man who should remain at home, and read or chat with the ladies
of his family, would be considered a bore and unmanly.&nbsp;
There seems to be no place in an American house for its
head.&nbsp; More than once when the friend I have referred to has
asked me, at the club, to dine informally with him, we have
found, on arriving, that Madame, having an evening off, had gone
to bed and forgotten to order any dinner, so we were obliged to
return to the club for our meal.&nbsp; When, however, his wife is
in good health, she expects her weary husband to accompany her to
dinner, opera, or ball, night after night, oblivious of the work
the morrow holds in store for him.</p>
<p>In one family I know, paterfamilias goes by the name of the
&ldquo;purse.&rdquo;&nbsp; The more one sees of American
households the more appropriate that name appears.&nbsp;
Everything is expected of the husband, and he is accorded no
definite place in return.&nbsp; He leaves the house at
8.30.&nbsp; When he returns, at five, if his wife is entertaining
a man at tea, it would be considered the height of indelicacy for
him to intrude upon them, for his arrival would cast a chill on
the conversation.&nbsp; When a couple dine out, the husband is
always <i>la b&ecirc;te noire</i> of the hostess, no woman
wanting to sit next to a married man, if she can help it.</p>
<p>The few Benedicts who have had the courage to break away from
these conditions and amuse themselves with yachts, salmon rivers,
or &ldquo;grass-bachelor&rdquo; trips to Europe, while secretly
admired by the women, are frowned upon in society as dangerous
examples, likely to sow the seeds of discontent among their
comrades; although it is the commonest thing in the world for an
American wife to take the children and go abroad on a tour.</p>
<p>Imagine a German or Italian wife announcing to her spouse that
she had decided to run over to England for a year with her
children, that they might learn English.&nbsp; The mind recoils
in horror from the idea of the catastrophe that would ensue.</p>
<p>Glance around a ball-room, a dinner party, or the opera, if
you have any doubts as to the unselfishness of our married
men.&nbsp; How many of them do you suppose are present for their
own pleasure?&nbsp; The owner of an opera box rarely retains a
seat in his expensive quarters.&nbsp; You generally find him
idling in the lobbies looking at his watch, or repairing to a
neighboring concert hall to pass the weary hours.&nbsp; At a ball
it is even worse.&nbsp; One wonders why card-rooms are not
provided at large balls (as is the custom abroad), where the
bored husbands might find a little solace over
&ldquo;bridge,&rdquo; instead of yawning in the coat-room or
making desperate signs to their wives from the
doorway,&mdash;signals of distress, by the bye, that rarely
produce any effect.</p>
<p>It is the rebellious husband who is admired and courted,
however.&nbsp; A curious trait of human nature compels admiration
for whatever is harmful, and forces us, in spite of our better
judgment, to depreciate the useful and beneficent.&nbsp; The
coats-of-arms of all countries are crowded with eagles and lions,
that never yet did any good, living or dead; orators enlarge on
the fine qualities of these birds and beasts, and hold them up as
models, while using as terms of reproach the name of the goose or
the cow, creatures that minister in a hundred ways to our
wants.&nbsp; Such a spirit has brought helpful, productive
&ldquo;better halves&rdquo; to the humble place they now occupy
in the eyes of our people.</p>
<p>As long as men passed their time in fighting and carousing
they were heroes; as soon as they became patient bread-winners
all the romance evaporated from their atmosphere.&nbsp; The
Jewish Hercules had his revenge in the end and made things
disagreeable for his tormentors.&nbsp; So far, however, there are
no signs of a revolt among the shorn lambs in this country.&nbsp;
They patiently bend their necks to the collar&mdash;the kindest,
most loving and devoted helpmates that ever plodded under the
matrimonial yoke.</p>
<p>When in the East, one watches with admiration the part a
donkey plays in the economy of those primitive lands.&nbsp; All
the work is reserved for that industrious animal, and little play
falls to his share.&nbsp; The camel is always bad-tempered, and
when overladen lies down, refusing to move until relieved of its
burden.&nbsp; The Turk is lazy and selfish, the native women pass
their time in chattering and giggling, the children play and
squabble, the ubiquitous dog sleeps in the sun; but from daybreak
to midnight the little mouse-colored donkeys toil
unceasingly.&nbsp; All burdens too bulky or too cumbersome for
man are put on his back; the provender which horses and camels
have refused becomes his portion; he is the first to begin the
day&rsquo;s labor, and the last to turn in.&nbsp; It is
impossible to live long in the Orient or the south of France
without becoming attached to those gentle, willing animals.&nbsp;
The r&ocirc;le which honest &ldquo;Bourico&rdquo; fills so well
abroad is played on this side of the Atlantic by the American
husband.</p>
<p>I mean no disrespect to my married compatriots; on the
contrary, I admire them as I do all docile, unselfish
beings.&nbsp; It is well for our women, however, that their
lords, like the little Oriental donkeys, ignore their strength,
and are content to toil on to the end of their days, expecting
neither praise nor thanks in return.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 14&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Carolus</i>&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In the early seventies a group of students&mdash;dissatisfied
with the cut-and-dried instruction of the Paris art school and
attracted by certain qualities of color and technique in the work
of a young Frenchman from the city of Lille, who was just
beginning to attract the attention of connoisseurs&mdash;went in
a body to his studio with the request that he would oversee their
work and direct their studies.&nbsp; The artist thus chosen was
Carolus-Duran.&nbsp; Oddly enough, a majority of the youths who
sought him out and made him their master were Americans.</p>
<p>The first modest workroom on the Boulevard Montparnasse was
soon too small to hold the pupils who crowded under this newly
raised banner, and a move was made to more commodious quarters
near the master&rsquo;s private studio.&nbsp; Sargent, Dannat,
Harrison, Beckwith, Hinckley, and many others whom it is needless
to mention here, will&mdash;if these lines come under their
notice&mdash;doubtless recall with a thrill of pleasure the roomy
one-storied structure in the rue Notre-Dame des Champs where we
established our <i>atelier d&rsquo;&eacute;l&egrave;ves</i>, a
self-supporting cooperative concern, each student contributing
ten francs a month toward rent, fire, and models,
&ldquo;Carolus&rdquo;&mdash;the name by which this master is
universally known abroad&mdash;not only refusing all
compensation, according to the immutable custom of French
painters of distinction, but, as we discovered later,
contributing too often from his own pocket to help out the
<i>massier</i> at the end of a difficult season, or smooth the
path of some improvident pupil.</p>
<p>Those were cloudless, enchanted days we passed in the tumbled
down old atelier: an ardent springtime of life when the future
beckons gayly and no doubts of success obscure the horizon.&nbsp;
Our young master&rsquo;s enthusiasm fired his circle of pupils,
who, as each succeeding year brought him increasing fame,
revelled in a reflected glory with the generous admiration of
youth, in which there is neither calculation nor shadow of
envy.</p>
<p>A portrait of Madame de Portalais, exhibited about this time,
drew all art-loving Paris around the new celebrity&rsquo;s
canvas.&nbsp; Shortly after, the government purchased a painting
(of our master&rsquo;s beautiful wife), now known as <i>La Femme
au Gant</i>, for the Luxembourg Gallery.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overestimate the impetus that a
master&rsquo;s successes impart to the progress of his
pupils.&nbsp; My first studious year in Paris had been passed in
the shadow of an elderly painter, who was comfortably dozing on
the laurels of thirty years before.&nbsp; The change from that
sleepy environment to the vivid enthusiasm and dash of
Carolus-Duran&rsquo;s studio was like stepping out of a musty
cloister into the warmth and movement of a market-place.</p>
<p>Here, be it said in passing, lies perhaps the secret of the
dry rot that too often settles on our American art schools.&nbsp;
We, for some unknown reason, do not take the work of native
painters seriously, nor encourage them in proportion to their
merit.&nbsp; In consequence they retain but a feeble hold upon
their pupils.</p>
<p>Carolus, handsome, young, successful, courted, was an ideal
leader for a band of ambitious, high-strung youths, repaying
their devotion with an untiring interest and lifting clever and
dull alike on the strong wings of his genius.&nbsp; His visits to
the studio, on which his friend Henner often accompanied him,
were frequent and prolonged; certain Tuesdays being especially
appreciated by us, as they were set apart for his criticism of
original compositions.</p>
<p>When our sketches (the subject for which had been given out in
advance) were arranged, and we had seated ourselves in a big
half-circle on the floor, Carolus would install himself on a tall
stool, the one seat the studio boasted, and chat <i>&agrave;
propos</i> of the works before him on composition, on classic
art, on the theories of color and clair-obscur.&nbsp; Brilliant
talks, inlaid with much wit and incisive criticism, the memory of
which must linger in the minds of all who were fortunate enough
to hear them.&nbsp; Nor was it to the studio alone that our
master&rsquo;s interest followed us.&nbsp; He would drop in at
the Louvre, when we were copying there, and after some pleasant
words of advice and encouragement, lead us off for a stroll
through the galleries, interrupted by stations before his
favorite masterpieces.</p>
<p>So important has he always considered a constant study of
Renaissance art that recently, when about to commence his
<i>Triumph of Bacchus</i>, Carolus copied one of Rubens&rsquo;s
larger canvases with all the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of a
beginner.</p>
<p>An occasion soon presented itself for us to learn another side
of our trade by working with our master on a ceiling ordered of
him by the state for the Palace of the Luxembourg.&nbsp; The vast
studios which the city of Paris provides on occasions of this
kind, with a liberality that should make our home corporations
reflect, are situated out beyond the Exhibition buildings, in a
curious, unfrequented quarter, ignored alike by Parisians and
tourists, where the city stores compromising statues and the
valuable d&eacute;bris of her many revolutions.&nbsp; There,
among throneless Napoleons and riderless bronze steeds, we toiled
for over six months side by side with our master, on gigantic
<i>Apotheosis of Marie de M&eacute;dicis</i>, serving in turn as
painter and painted, and leaving the imprint of our hands and the
reflection of our faces scattered about the composition.&nbsp;
Day after day, when work was over, we would hoist the big canvas
by means of a system of ropes and pulleys, from a perpendicular
to the horizontal position it was to occupy permanently, and then
sit straining our necks and discussing the progress of the work
until the tardy spring twilight warned us to depart.</p>
<p>The year 1877 brought Carolus-Duran the <i>m&eacute;daille
d&rsquo;honneur</i>, a crowning recompense that set the atelier
mad with delight.&nbsp; We immediately organized a great (but
economical) banquet to commemorate the event, over which our
master presided, with much modesty, considering the amount of
incense we burned before him, and the speeches we made.&nbsp; One
of our number even burst into some very bad French verses,
asserting that the painters of the world in general fell back
before him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . <i>&eacute;pouvant&egrave;s</i>&mdash;<br />
<i>Craignant &egrave;galement sa brosse et son
&egrave;p&egrave;e</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allusion to his proficiency in fencing was considered
particularly neat, and became the favorite song of the studio, to
be howled in and out of season.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, there is always something in
Carolus-Duran&rsquo;s attitude when at work which recalls the
swordsman.&nbsp; With an enormous palette in one hand and a brush
in the other, he has a way of planting himself in front of his
sitter that is amusingly suggestive of a duel.&nbsp; His lithe
body sways to and fro, his fine leonine face quivers with the
intense study of his model; then with a sudden spring forward, a
few rapid touches are dashed on the canvas (like home strokes in
the enemy&rsquo;s weakest spot) with a precision of hand acquired
only by long years of fencing.</p>
<p>An order to paint the king and queen of Portugal was the next
step on the road to fame, another rung on the pleasant ladder of
success.&nbsp; When this work was done the delighted sovereign
presented the painter with the order of &ldquo;Christ of
Portugal,&rdquo; together with many other gifts, among which a
caricature of the master at work, signed by his sitter, is not
the least valued.</p>
<p>When the great schism occurred several years ago which rent
the art world of France, Carolus-Duran was elected vice-president
of the new school under Meissonier, to whose office he succeeded
on that master&rsquo;s death; and now directs and presides over
the yearly exhibition known as the <i>Salon du Champ de
Mars</i>.</p>
<p>At his ch&acirc;teau near Paris or at Saint Raphael, on the
Mediterranean, the master lives, like Leonardo of old, the
existence of a grand seigneur, surrounded by his family,
innumerable guests, and the horses and dogs he loves,&mdash;a
group of which his ornate figure and expressive face form the
natural centre.&nbsp; Each year he lives more away from the
world, but no more inspiriting sight can be imagined than the
welcome the president receives of a &ldquo;varnishing&rdquo; day,
when he makes his entry surrounded by his pupils.&nbsp; The
students cheer themselves hoarse, and the public climbs on
everything that comes to hand to see him pass.&nbsp; It is hard
to realize then that this is the same man who, not content with
his youthful progress, retired into an Italian monastery that he
might commune face to face with nature undisturbed.</p>
<p>The works of no other painter give me the same sensation of
quivering vitality, except the Velasquez in the Madrid Gallery
and, perhaps, Sargent at his best; and one feels all through the
American painter&rsquo;s work the influence of his first and only
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tout ce qui n&rsquo;est pas indispensable est
nuisible</i>,&rdquo; a phrase which is often on
Carolus-Duran&rsquo;s lips, may be taken as the keynote of his
work, where one finds a noble simplicity of line and color
scheme, an elimination of useless detail, a contempt for tricks
to enforce an effect, and above all a comprehension and mastery
of light, vitality, and texture&mdash;those three unities of the
painter&rsquo;s art&mdash;that bring his canvases very near to
those of his self-imposed Spanish master.</p>
<p>Those who know the French painter&rsquo;s more important works
and his many splendid studies from the nude, feel it a pity that
such masterpieces as the equestrian portrait of Mlle. Croisette,
of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, the <i>R&eacute;veil</i>,
the superb full length of Mme. Pelouse on the Terrace of
Chenonceau, and the head of Gounod in the Luxembourg, could not
be collected into one exhibition, that lovers of art here in
America might realize for themselves how this master&rsquo;s
works are of the class that typify a school and an epoch, and
engrave their author&rsquo;s name among those destined to become
household words in the mouths of future generations.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 15&mdash;The Grand Opera Fad</h2>
<p>Without being more curious than my neighbors, there are
several social mysteries that I should like to fathom, among
others, the real reasons that induce the different classes of
people one sees at the opera to attend that form of
entertainment.</p>
<p>A taste for the theatre is natural enough.&nbsp; It is also
easy to understand why people who are fond of sport and animals
enjoy races and dog shows.&nbsp; But the continued vogue of grand
opera, and more especially of Wagner&rsquo;s long-drawn-out
compositions, among our restless, unmusical compatriots, remains
unexplained.</p>
<p>The sheeplike docility of our public is apparent in numberless
ways; in none, however, more strikingly than in their choice of
amusements.&nbsp; In business and religion, people occasionally
think for themselves; in the selection of entertainments, never!
but are apparently content to receive their opinions and
prejudices ready-made from some unseen and omnipotent
Areopagus.</p>
<p>The careful study of an opera audience from different parts of
our auditorium has brought me to the conclusion that the public
there may be loosely divided into three classes&mdash;leaving out
reporters of fashionable intelligence, dressmakers in search of
ideas, and the lady inhabitants of &ldquo;Crank Alley&rdquo; (as
a certain corner of the orchestra is called), who sit in
perpetual adoration before the elderly tenor.</p>
<p>First&mdash;but before venturing further on dangerously thin
ice, it may be as well to suggest that this subject is not
treated in absolute seriousness, and that all assertions must not
be taken <i>au pied de la lettre</i>.&nbsp; First, then, and most
important, come the stockholders, for without them the
Metropolitan would close.&nbsp; The majority of these fortunate
people and their guests look upon the opera as a social function,
where one can meet one&rsquo;s friends and be seen, an
entertaining antechamber in which to linger until it&rsquo;s time
to &ldquo;go on,&rdquo; her Box being to-day as necessary a part
of a great lady&rsquo;s outfit as a country house or a
ball-room.</p>
<p>Second are those who attend because it has become the correct
thing to be seen at the opera.&nbsp; There is so much wealth in
this city and so little opportunity for its display, so many
people long to go about who are asked nowhere, that the opera has
been seized upon as a centre in which to air rich apparel and
elbow the &ldquo;world.&rdquo;&nbsp; This list fills a large part
of the closely packed parquet and first balcony.</p>
<p>Third, and last, come the lovers of music, who mostly inhabit
greater altitudes.</p>
<p>The motive of the typical box-owner is simple.&nbsp; Her night
at the opera is the excuse for a cosy little dinner, one woman
friend (two would spoil the effect of the box) and four men,
without counting the husband, who appears at dinner, but rarely
goes further.&nbsp; The pleasant meal and the subsequent smoke
are prolonged until 9 or 9.30, when the men are finally dragged
murmuring from their cigars.&nbsp; If she has been fortunate and
timed her arrival to correspond with an <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i>,
my lady is radiant.&nbsp; The lights are up, she can see who are
present, and the public can inspect her toilet and jewels as she
settles herself under the combined gaze of the house, and
proceeds to hold an informal reception for the rest of the
evening.&nbsp; The men she has brought with her quickly cede
their places to callers, and wander yawning in the lobby or
invade the neighboring boxes and add their voices to the general
murmur.</p>
<p>Although there is much less talking than formerly, it is the
toleration of this custom at all by the public that indicates
(along with many other straws) that we are not a music-loving
people.&nbsp; Audible conversation during a performance would not
be allowed for a moment by a Continental audience.&nbsp; The
little visiting that takes place in boxes abroad is done during
the <i>entr&rsquo;actes</i>, when people retire to the salons
back of their <i>loges</i> to eat ices and chat.&nbsp; Here those
little parlors are turned into cloak-rooms, and small talk goes
on in many boxes during the entire performance.&nbsp; The joke or
scandal of the day is discussed; strangers in town, or literary
and artistic lights&mdash;&ldquo;freaks,&rdquo; they are
discriminatingly called&mdash;are pointed out, toilets passed in
review, and those dreadful two hours passed which, for some
undiscovered reason, must elapse between a dinner and a
dance.&nbsp; If a favorite tenor is singing, and no one happens
to be whispering nonsense over her shoulder, my lady may listen
in a distrait way.&nbsp; It is not safe, however, to count on
prolonged attention or ask her questions about the
performance.&nbsp; She is apt to be a bit hazy as to who is
singing, and with the exception of <i>Faust</i> and
<i>Carmen</i>, has rudimentary ideas about plots.&nbsp; Singers
come and go, weep, swoon, or are killed, without interfering with
her equanimity.&nbsp; She has, for instance, seen the
<i>Huguenots</i> and the <i>Rheingold</i> dozens of times, but
knows no more why Raoul is brought blindfolded to Chenonceaux, or
what Wotan and Erda say to each other in their interminable
scenes, than she does of the contents of the Vedas.&nbsp; For the
matter of that, if three or four principal airs were suppressed
from an opera and the scenery and costumes changed, many in that
chattering circle would, I fear, not know what they were
listening to.</p>
<p>Last winter, when Melba sang in <i>Aida</i>, disguised by dark
hair and a brown skin, a lady near me vouchsafed the opinion that
the &ldquo;little black woman hadn&rsquo;t a bad voice;&rdquo; a
gentleman (to whom I remarked last week &ldquo;that as Sembrich
had sung Rosina in the <i>Barber</i>, it was rather a shock to
see her appear as that lady&rsquo;s servant in the <i>Mariage de
Figaro</i>&rdquo;) looked his blank amazement until it was
explained to him that one of those operas was a continuation of
the other.&nbsp; After a pause he remarked, &ldquo;They are not
by the same composer, anyway!&nbsp; Because the first&rsquo;s by
Rossini, and the <i>Mariage</i> is by Bon March&eacute;.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been at his shop in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The presence of the second category&mdash;the would-be
fashionable people&mdash;is not so easily accounted for.&nbsp;
Their attendance can hardly be attributed to love of melody, as
they are, if anything, a shade less musical than the
box-dwellers, who, by the bye, seem to exercise an irresistible
fascination, to judge by the trend of conversation and direction
of glasses.&nbsp; Although an imposing and sufficiently attentive
throng, it would be difficult to find a less discriminating
public than that which gathers nightly in the Metropolitan
parterre.&nbsp; One wonders how many of those people care for
music and how many attend because it is expensive and
&ldquo;swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They will listen with the same bland contentment to either bad
or good performances so long as a world-renowned artist (some one
who is being paid a comfortable little fortune for the evening)
is on the stage.&nbsp; The orchestra may be badly led (it often
is); the singers may flat&mdash;or be out of voice; the
performance may go all at sixes and sevens&mdash;there is never a
murmur of dissent.&nbsp; Faults that would set an entire audience
at Naples or Milan hissing are accepted herewith ignorant
approval.</p>
<p>The unfortunate part of it is that this weakness of ours has
become known.&nbsp; The singers feel they can give an American
audience any slipshod performance.&nbsp; I have seen a favorite
soprano shrug her shoulders as she entered her dressing-room and
exclaim: &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!&nbsp; How I shuffled through
that act!&nbsp; They&rsquo;d have hooted me off the stage in
Berlin, but here no one seems to care.&nbsp; Did you notice the
baritone to-night?&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t on the key once during
our duo.&nbsp; I cannot sing my best, try as I will, when I hear
the public applauding good and bad alike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is strange that our pleasure-loving rich people should have
hit on the opera as a favorite haunt.&nbsp; We and the English
are the only race who will attend performances in a foreign
language which we don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; How can
intelligent people who don&rsquo;t care for music go on, season
after season, listening to operas, the plots of which they
ignore, and which in their hearts they find dull?</p>
<p>Is it so very amusing to watch two middle-aged ladies nagging
each other, at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, on a public
square, as they do in <i>Lohengrin</i>?&nbsp; Do people find the
lecture that Isolde&rsquo;s husband delivers to the guilty lovers
entertaining?&nbsp; Does an opera produce any illusion on my
neighbors?&nbsp; I wish it did on me!&nbsp; I see too plainly the
paint on the singers&rsquo; hot faces and the cords straining in
their tired throats!&nbsp; I sit on certain nights in agony,
fearing to see stout Romeo roll on the stage in apoplexy!&nbsp;
The sopranos, too, have a way, when about to emit a roulade, that
is more suggestive of a dentist&rsquo;s chair, and the attendant
gargle, than of a love phrase.</p>
<p>When two celebrities combine in a final duo, facing the public
and not each other, they give the impression of victims whom an
unseen inquisitor is torturing.&nbsp; Each turn of his screw
draws out a wilder cry.&nbsp; The orchestra (in the pay of the
demon) does all it can to prevent their shrieks from reaching the
public.&nbsp; The lovers in turn redouble their efforts; they are
purple in the face and glistening with perspiration.&nbsp;
Defeat, they know, is before them, for the orchestra has the
greater staying power!&nbsp; The flutes bleat; the trombones
grunt; the fiddles squeal; an epileptic leader cuts wildly into
the air about him.&nbsp; When, finally, their strength exhausted,
the breathless human beings, with one last ear-piercing note,
give up the struggle and retire, the public, excited by the
unequal contest, bursts into thunders of applause.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea, in order to avoid these
painful exhibitions, to have an arrangement of screens, with the
singing people behind and a company of young and attractive
pantomimists going through the gestures and movements in
front?&nbsp; Otherwise, how can the most imaginative natures lose
themselves at an opera?&nbsp; Even when the singers are comely,
there is always that eternal double row of stony-faced witnesses
in full view, whom no crimes astonish and no misfortunes
melt.&nbsp; It takes most of the poetry out of Faust&rsquo;s
first words with Marguerite, to have that short interview
interrupted by a line of old, weary women shouting, &ldquo;Let us
whirl in the waltz o&rsquo;er the mount and the
plain!&rdquo;&nbsp; Or when Scotch Lucy appears in a smart
tea-gown and is good enough to perform difficult exercises before
a half-circle of Italian gentlemen in pantalets and ladies in
court costumes, does she give any one the illusion of an
abandoned wife dying of a broken heart alone in the
Highlands?&nbsp; Broken heart, indeed!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s much more
likely she&rsquo;ll die of a ruptured blood-vessel!</p>
<p>Philistines in matters musical, like myself, unfortunate
mortals whom the sweetest sounds fail to enthrall when connected
with no memory or idea, or when prolonged beyond a limited
period, must approach the third group with hesitation and
awe.&nbsp; That they are sincere, is evident.&nbsp; The rapt
expressions of their faces, and their patience, bear testimony to
this fact.&nbsp; For a long time I asked myself, &ldquo;Where
have I seen that intense, absorbed attitude before?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Suddenly one evening another scene rose in my memory.</p>
<p>Have you ever visited Tangiers?&nbsp; In the market-place of
that city you will find the inhabitants crouched by hundreds
around their native musicians.&nbsp; When we were there, one old
duffer&mdash;the Wagner, doubtless, of the place&mdash;was having
an immense success.&nbsp; No matter at what hour of the day we
passed through that square, there was always the same spellbound
circle of half-clad Turks and Arabs squatting silent while
&ldquo;Wagner&rdquo; tinkled to them on a three-stringed lute and
chanted in a high-pitched, dismal whine&mdash;like the squeaking
of an unfastened door in the wind.&nbsp; At times, for no
apparent reason, the never-varying, never-ending measure would be
interrupted by a flutter of applause, but his audience remained
mostly sunk in a hypnotic apathy.&nbsp; I never see a
&ldquo;Ring&rdquo; audience now without thinking of that scene
outside the Bab-el-Marsa gate, which has led me to ask different
people just what sensations serious music produced upon
them.&nbsp; The answers have been varied and interesting.&nbsp;
One good lady who rarely misses a German opera confessed that
sweet sounds acted upon her like opium.&nbsp; Neither scenery nor
acting nor plot were of any importance.&nbsp; From the first
notes of the overture to the end, she floated in an ecstatic
dream, oblivious of time and place.&nbsp; When it was over she
came back to herself faint with fatigue.&nbsp; Another professed
lover of Wagner said that his greatest pleasure was in following
the different &ldquo;motives&rdquo; as they recurred in the
music.&nbsp; My faith in that gentleman was shaken, however, when
I found the other evening that he had mistaken Van Dyck for Jean
de Reszk&eacute; through an entire performance.&nbsp; He may be a
dab at recognizing his friends the &ldquo;motives,&rdquo; but his
discoveries don&rsquo;t apparently go as far as tenors!</p>
<p>No one doubts that hundreds of people unaffectedly love German
opera, but that as many affect to appreciate it in order to
appear intellectual is certain.</p>
<p>Once upon a time the unworthy member of an ultra-serious
&ldquo;Browning&rdquo; class in this city, doubting the sincerity
of her companions, asked permission to read them a poem of the
master&rsquo;s which she found beyond her comprehension.&nbsp;
When the reading was over the opinion of her friends was
unanimous.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing could be simpler!&nbsp; The lines
were lucidity itself!&nbsp; Such close reasoning
etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; But dismay fell upon them when the naughty lady
announced, with a peal of laughter, that she had been reading
alternate lines from opposite pages.&nbsp; She no longer disturbs
the harmony of that circle!</p>
<p>Bearing this tale in mind, I once asked a musician what
proportion of the audience at a &ldquo;Ring&rdquo; performance he
thought would know if alternate scenes were given from two of
Wagner&rsquo;s operas, unless the scenery enlightened them.&nbsp;
His estimate was that perhaps fifty per cent might find out the
fraud.&nbsp; He put the number of people who could give an
intelligent account of those plots at about thirty per
hundred.</p>
<p>The popularity of music, he added, is largely due to the fact
that it saves people the trouble of thinking.&nbsp; Pleasant
sounds soothe the nerves, and, if prolonged long enough in a
darkened room will, like the Eastern tom-toms, lull the senses
into a mild form of trance.&nbsp; This must be what the gentleman
meant who said he wished he could sleep as well in a
&ldquo;Wagner&rdquo; car as he did at one of his operas!</p>
<p>Being a tailless old fox, I look with ever-increasing
suspicion on the too-luxuriant caudal appendages of my neighbors,
and think with amusement of the multitudes who during the last
ten years have sacrificed themselves upon the altar of grand
opera&mdash;simple, kindly souls, with little or no taste for
classical music, who have sat in the dark (mentally and
physically), applauding what they didn&rsquo;t understand, and
listening to vague German mythology set to sounds that appear to
us outsiders like music sunk into a verbose dotage.&nbsp; I am
convinced the greater number would have preferred a jolly
performance of <i>Mme. Angot</i> or the <i>Cloches de
Corneville</i>, cut in two by a good ballet.</p>
<p>It is, however, so easy to be mistaken on subjects of this
kind that generalizing is dangerous.&nbsp; Many great authorities
have liked tuneless music.&nbsp; One of the most telling
arguments in its favor was recently advanced by a
foreigner.&nbsp; The Chinese ambassador told us last winter in a
club at Washington that Wagner&rsquo;s was the only European
music that he appreciated and enjoyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;music is a much older art with us
than in Europe, and has naturally reached a far greater
perfection.&nbsp; The German school has made a long step in
advance, and I can now foresee a day not far distant when, under
its influence, your music will closely resemble our
own.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 16&mdash;The Poetic <i>Cabarets</i> of Paris</h2>
<p>Those who have not lived in France can form little idea of the
important place the <i>caf&eacute;</i> occupies in the life of an
average Frenchman, clubs as we know them or as they exist in
England being rare, and when found being, with few exceptions,
but gambling-houses in disguise.&nbsp; As a Frenchman rarely asks
an acquaintance, or even a friend, to his apartment, the
<i>caf&eacute;</i> has become the common ground where all meet,
for business or pleasure.&nbsp; Not in Paris only, but all over
France, in every garrison town, provincial city, or tiny village,
the <i>caf&eacute;</i> is the chief attraction, the centre of
thought, the focus toward which all the rays of masculine
existence converge.</p>
<p>For the student, newly arrived from the provinces, to whose
modest purse the theatres and other places of amusement are
practically closed, the <i>caf&eacute;</i> is a supreme
resource.&nbsp; His mind is moulded, his ideas and opinions
formed, more by what he hears and sees there than by any other
influence.&nbsp; A restaurant is of little importance.&nbsp; One
may eat anywhere.&nbsp; But the choice of his <i>caf&eacute;</i>
will often give the bent to a young man&rsquo;s career, and
indicate his exact shade of politics and his opinions on
literature, music, or art.&nbsp; In Paris, to know a man at all
is to know where you can find him at the hour of the
<i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>&mdash;what Baudelaire called</p>
<blockquote><p><i>L&rsquo;heure sainte</i><br />
<i>De l&rsquo;absinthe</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When young men form a society among themselves, a
<i>caf&eacute;</i> is chosen as their meeting-place.&nbsp;
Thousands of establishments exist only by such patronage, as, for
example, the Caf&eacute; de la R&eacute;gence, Place du
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, which is frequented
entirely by men who play chess.</p>
<p>Business men transact their affairs as much over their coffee
as in their offices.&nbsp; The reading man finds at his
<i>caf&eacute;</i> the daily and weekly papers; a writer is sure
of the undisturbed possession of pen, ink, and paper.&nbsp; Henri
Murger, the author, when asked once why he continued to patronize
a certain establishment notorious for the inferior quality of its
beer, answered, &ldquo;Yes, the beer is poor, but they keep such
good <i>ink</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of a <i>caf&eacute;</i> does not imply any great
expenditure, a <i>consummation</i> costing but little.&nbsp; With
it is acquired the right to use the establishment for an
indefinite number of hours, the client being warmed, lighted, and
served.&nbsp; From five to seven, and again after dinner, the
<i>habitu&eacute;s</i> stroll in, grouping themselves about the
small tables, each new-comer joining a congenial circle, ordering
his drink, and settling himself for a long sitting.&nbsp; The
last editorial, the newest picture, or the fall of a ministry is
discussed with a vehemence and an interest unknown to Anglo-Saxon
natures.&nbsp; Suddenly, in the excitement of the discussion,
some one will rise in his place and begin speaking.&nbsp; If you
happen to drop in at that moment, the lady at the desk will
welcome you with, &ldquo;You are just in time!&nbsp; Monsieur
So-and-So is speaking; the evening promises to be
interesting.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is charmed; her establishment will
shine with a reflected light, and new patrons be drawn there, if
the debates are brilliant.&nbsp; So universal is this custom that
there is hardly an orator to-day at the French bar or in the
Senate, who has not broken his first lance in some such obscure
tournament, under the smiling glances of the <i>dame du
comptoir</i>.</p>
<p>Opposite the Palace of the Luxembourg, in the heart of the old
Latin Quarter, stands a quaint building, half hotel, half
<i>caf&eacute;</i>, where many years ago Joseph II. resided while
visiting his sister, Marie Antoinette.&nbsp; It is known now as
Foyot&rsquo;s; this name must awaken many happy memories in the
hearts of American students, for it was long their favorite
meeting-place.&nbsp; In the early seventies a club, formed among
the literary and poetic youth of Paris, selected Foyot&rsquo;s as
their &ldquo;home&rdquo; during the winter months.&nbsp; Their
summer vacations were spent in visiting the university towns of
France, reciting verses, or acting in original plays at Nancy,
Bordeaux, Lyons, or Caen.&nbsp; The enthusiasm these youthful
performances created inspired one of their number with the idea
of creating in Paris, on a permanent footing, a centre where a
limited public could meet the young poets of the day and hear
them recite their verses and monologues in an informal way.</p>
<p>The success of the original &ldquo;Chat Noir,&rdquo; the first
<i>cabaret</i> of this kind, was largely owing to the sympathetic
and attractive nature of its founder, young Salis, who drew
around him, by his sunny disposition, shy personalities who, but
for him, would still be &ldquo;mute, inglorious
Miltons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under his kindly and discriminating rule
many a successful literary career has started.&nbsp;
Salis&rsquo;s gifted nature combined a delicate taste and
critical acumen with a rare business ability.&nbsp; His first
venture, an obscure little <i>caf&eacute;</i> on the Boulevard
Rochechouart, in the outlying quarter beyond the Place Pigalle,
quickly became famous, its ever-increasing vogue forcing its
happy proprietor to seek more commodious quarters in the rue
Victor Mass&eacute;, where the world-famous &ldquo;Chat
Noir&rdquo; was installed with much pomp and many joyous
ceremonies.</p>
<p>The old word <i>cabaret</i>, corresponding closely to our
English &ldquo;inn,&rdquo; was chosen, and the establishment
decorated in imitation of a Louis XIII.
<i>h&ocirc;tellerie</i>.&nbsp; Oaken beams supported the
low-studded ceilings: The plaster walls disappeared behind
tapestries, armor, old <i>fa&iuml;ence</i>.&nbsp; Beer and other
liquids were served in quaint porcelain or pewter mugs, and the
waiters were dressed (merry anachronism) in the costume of
members of the Institute (the Immortal Forty), who had so long
led poetry in chains.&nbsp; The success of the &ldquo;Black
Cat&rdquo; in her new quarters was immense, all Paris crowding
through her modest doors.&nbsp; Salis had founded
Montmartre!&mdash;the rugged old hill giving birth to a
generation of writers and poets, and nourishing this new school
at her granite breasts.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to imagine a form of entertainment more
tempting than was offered in this picturesque inn.&nbsp; In
addition to the first, the entire second floor of the building
had been thrown into one large room, the walls covered with a
thousand sketches, caricatures, and crayon drawings by hands
since celebrated the world over.&nbsp; A piano, with many chairs
and tables, completed the unpretending installation.&nbsp; Here,
during a couple of hours each evening, either by the piano or
simply standing in their places, the young poets gave utterance
to the creations of their imagination, the musicians played their
latest inspirations, the <i>raconteur</i> told his newest
story.&nbsp; They called each other and the better known among
the guests by their names, and joked mutual weaknesses,
eliminating from these gatherings every shade of a perfunctory
performance.</p>
<p>It is impossible to give an idea of the delicate flavor of
such informal evenings&mdash;the sensation of being at home that
the picturesque surroundings produced, the low murmur of
conversation, the clink of glasses, the swing of the waltz
movement played by a master hand, interrupted only when some
slender form would lean against the piano and pour forth burning
words of infinite pathos,&mdash;the inspired young face lighted
up by the passion and power of the lines.&nbsp; The burst of
applause that his talent called forth would hardly have died away
before another figure would take the poet&rsquo;s place, a wave
of laughter welcoming the new-comer, whose twinkling eyes and
demure smile promised a treat of fun and humor.&nbsp; So the
evening would wear gayly to its end, the younger element in the
audience, full of the future, drinking in long draughts of poetry
and art, the elders charmed to live over again the days of their
youth and feel in touch once more with the present.</p>
<p>In this world of routine and conventions an innovation as
brilliantly successful as this could hardly be inaugurated
without raising a whirlwind of jealousy and opposition.&nbsp; The
struggle was long and arduous.&nbsp; Directors of theatres and
concert halls, furious to see a part of their public tempted
away, raised the cry of immorality against the new-comers, and
called to their aid every resource of law and chicanery.&nbsp; At
the end of the first year Salis found himself with over eight
hundred summonses and lawsuits on his hands.&nbsp; After having
made every effort, knocked at every door, in his struggle for
existence, he finally conceived the happy thought of appealing
directly to Gr&eacute;vy, then President of the Republic, and in
his audience with the latter succeeded in charming and
interesting him, as he had so many others.&nbsp; The influence of
the head of the state once brought to bear on the affair, Salis
had the joy of seeing opposition crushed and the storm blow
itself out.</p>
<p>From this moment, the poets, feeling themselves appreciated
and their rights acknowledged and defended, flocked to the
&ldquo;Sacred Mountain,&rdquo; as Montmartre began to be called;
other establishments of the same character sprang up in the
neighborhood.&nbsp; Most important among these were the &ldquo;4
z&rsquo;Arts,&rdquo; Boulevard de Clichy, the
&ldquo;Tambourin,&rdquo; and La Butte.</p>
<p>Trombert, who, together with Fragerolle, Goudezki, and Marcel
Lef&egrave;vre, had just ended an artistic voyage in the south of
France, opened the &ldquo;4 z&rsquo;Arts,&rdquo; to which the
novelty-loving public quickly found its way, crowding to applaud
Coquelin <i>cadet</i>, Fragson, and other budding
celebrities.&nbsp; It was here that the poets first had the idea
of producing a piece in which rival <i>cabarets</i> were reviewed
and laughingly criticised.&nbsp; The success was beyond all
precedent, in spite of the difficulty of giving a play without a
stage, without scenery or accessories of any kind, the interest
centring in the talent with which the lines were declaimed by
their authors, who next had the pleasant thought of passing in
review the different classes of popular songs, Clovis Hugues, at
the same time poet and statesman, discoursing on each subject,
and introducing the singer; Brittany local songs,
Proven&ccedil;al ballads, ant the half Spanish, half French
<i>chansons</i> of the Pyrenees were sung or recited by local
poets with the charm and abandon of their distinctive races.</p>
<p>The great critics did not disdain to attend these informal
gatherings, nor to write columns of serious criticism on the
subject in their papers.</p>
<p>At the hour when all Paris takes its <i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>
the &ldquo;4 z&rsquo;Arts&rdquo; became the meeting-place of the
painters, poets, and writers of the day.&nbsp; Montmartre
gradually replaced the old Latin Quarter; it is there to-day that
one must seek for the gayety and humor, the pathos and the
makeshifts of Bohemia.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;4 z&rsquo;Arts,&rdquo; next to the &ldquo;Chat
Noir,&rdquo; has had the greatest influence on the taste of our
time,&mdash;the pleiad of poets that grouped themselves around it
in the beginning, dispersing later to form other centres, which,
in their turn, were to influence the minds and moods of
thousands.</p>
<p>Another charming form of entertainment inaugurated by this
group of men is that of &ldquo;shadow pictures,&rdquo; conceived
originally by Caran d&rsquo;Ache, and carried by him to a
marvellous perfection.&nbsp; A medium-sized frame filled with
ground glass is suspended at one end of a room and surrounded by
sombre draperies.&nbsp; The room is darkened; against the
luminous background of the glass appear small black groups
(shadows cast by figures cut out of cardboard).&nbsp; These
figures move, advancing and retreating, grouping or separating
themselves to the cadence of the poet&rsquo;s verses, for which
they form the most original and striking illustrations.&nbsp;
Entire poems are given accompanied by these shadow pictures.</p>
<p>One of Caran d&rsquo;Ache&rsquo;s greatest successes in this
line was an <i>Epop&eacute;e de Napol&eacute;on</i>,&mdash;the
great Emperor appearing on foot and on horseback, the long lines
of his army passing before him in the foreground or small in the
distance.&nbsp; They stormed heights, cheered on by his presence,
or formed hollow squares to repulse the enemy.&nbsp; During their
evolutions, the clear voice of the poet rang out from the
darkness with thrilling effect.</p>
<p>The nicest art is necessary to cut these little figures to the
required perfection.&nbsp; So great was the talent of their
inventor that, when he gave burlesques of the topics of the day,
or presented the celebrities of the hour to his public, each
figure would be recognized with a burst of delighted
applause.&nbsp; The great Sarah was represented in poses of
infinite humor, surrounded by her menagerie or receiving the
homage of the universe.&nbsp; Political leaders, foreign
sovereigns, social and operatic stars, were made to pass before a
laughing public.&nbsp; None were spared.&nbsp; Paris went mad
with delight at this new &ldquo;art,&rdquo; and for months it was
impossible to find a seat vacant in the hall.</p>
<p>At the Boite &agrave; Musique, the idea was further
developed.&nbsp; By an ingenious arrangement of lights, of which
the secret has been carefully kept, landscapes are represented in
color; all the gradations of light are given, from the varied
twilight hues to purple night, until the moon, rising, lights
anew the picture.&nbsp; During all these variations of color
little groups continue to come and go, acting out the story of a
poem, which the poet delivers from the surrounding obscurity as
only an author can render his own lines.</p>
<p>One of the pillars of this attractive centre was Jules Jouy,
who made a large place for himself in the hearts of his
contemporaries&mdash;a true poet, whom neither privations nor the
difficult beginnings of an unknown writer could turn from his
vocation.&nbsp; His songs are alternately tender, gay, and
bitingly sarcastic.&nbsp; Some of his better-known ballads were
written for and marvellously interpreted by Yvette
Guilbert.&nbsp; The difficult critics, Sarcey and Jules
Lema&icirc;tre, have sounded his praise again and again.</p>
<p>A <i>cabaret</i> of another kind which enjoyed much celebrity,
more on account of the personality of the poet who founded it
than from any originality or picturesqueness in its intallation,
was the &ldquo;Mirliton,&rdquo; opened by Aristide Bruant in the
little rooms that had sheltered the original &ldquo;Chat
Noir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To give an account of the &ldquo;Mirliton&rdquo; is to tell
the story of Bruant, the most popular ballad-writer in France
to-day.&nbsp; This original and eccentric poet is as well-known
to a Parisian as the boulevards or the Arc de Triomphe.&nbsp; His
costume of shabby black velvet, Brittany waistcoat, red shirt,
top-boots, and enormous hat is a familiar feature in the
caricatures and prints of the day.&nbsp; His little
<i>cabaret</i> remains closed during the day, opening its doors
toward evening.&nbsp; The personality of the ballad-writer
pervades the atmosphere.&nbsp; He walks about the tiny place
hailing his acquaintances with some gay epigram, receiving
strangers with easy familiarity or chilling disdain, as the humor
takes him; then in a moment, with a rapid change of expression,
pouring out the ringing lines of one of his ballads&mdash;always
the story of the poor and humble, for he has identified himself
with the outcast and the disinherited.&nbsp; His volumes <i>Dans
la Rue</i> and <i>Sur la Route</i> have had an enormous
popularity, their contents being known and sung all over
France.</p>
<p>In 1892 Bruant was received as a member of the society of
<i>Gens de Lettres</i>.&nbsp; It may be of interest to recall a
part of the speech made by Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e on the
occasion: &ldquo;It is with the greatest pleasure that I present
to my confr&egrave;res my good friend, the ballad-writer,
Aristide Bruant.&nbsp; I value highly the author of <i>Dans la
Rue</i>.&nbsp; When I close his volume of sad and caustic verses
it is with the consoling thought that even vice and crime have
their conscience: that if there is suffering there is a possible
redemption.&nbsp; He has sought his inspiration in the gutter, it
is true, but he has seen there a reflection of the
stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Avenue Trudaine, not far from the other
<i>cabarets</i>, the &ldquo;Ane Rouge&rdquo; was next opened, in
a quiet corner of the immense suburb, its shady-little garden, on
which the rooms open, making it a favorite meeting-place during
the warm months.&nbsp; Of a summer evening no more congenial spot
can be found in all Paris.&nbsp; The quaint chambers have been
covered with mural paintings or charcoal caricatures of the poets
themselves, or of familiar faces among the clients and patrons of
the place.</p>
<p>One of the many talents that clustered around this quiet
little garden was the brilliant Paul Verlaine, the most Bohemian
of all inhabitants of modern Prague, whose death has left a void,
difficult to fill.&nbsp; Fame and honors came too late.&nbsp; He
died in destitution, if not absolutely of hunger; to-day his
admirers are erecting a bronze bust of him in the Garden of the
Luxembourg, with money that would have gone far toward making his
life happy.</p>
<p>In the old h&ocirc;tel of the Lesdigui&egrave;res family, rue
de la Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne, the &ldquo;Carillon&rdquo; opened
its doors in 1893, and quickly conquered a place in the public
favor, the inimitable fun and spirits of Tiercy drawing crowds to
the place.</p>
<p>The famous &ldquo;Tr&eacute;teau de Tabarin,&rdquo; which
to-day holds undisputed precedence over all the <i>cabarets</i>
of Paris, was among the last to appear.&nbsp; It was founded by
the brilliant Fursy and a group of his friends.&nbsp; Here no
pains have been spared to form a setting worthy of the poets and
their public.</p>
<p>Many years ago, in the days of the good king Louis XIII., a
strolling poet-actor, Tabarin, erected his little canvas-covered
stage before the statue of Henry IV., on the Pont-Neuf, and drew
the court and the town by his fun and pathos.&nbsp; The founders
of the latest and most complete of Parisian <i>cabarets</i> have
reconstructed, as far as possible, this historic scene.&nbsp; On
the wall of the room where the performances are given, is painted
a view of old Paris, the Seine and its bridges, the towers of
Notre Dame in the distance, and the statue of Louis XIII.&rsquo;s
warlike father in the foreground.&nbsp; In front of this painting
stands a staging of rough planks, reproducing the little theatre
of Tabarin.&nbsp; Here, every evening, the authors and poets play
in their own pieces, recite their verses, and tell their
stories.&nbsp; Not long ago a young musician, who has already
given an opera to the world, sang an entire one-act operetta of
his composition, changing his voice for the different parts,
imitating choruses by clever effects on the piano.</p>
<p>Montmartre is now sprinkled with attractive <i>cabarets</i>,
the taste of the public for such informal entertainments having
grown each year; with reason, for the careless grace of the
surroundings, the absence of any useless restraint or obligation
as to hour or duration, has a charm for thousands whom a long
concert or the inevitable five acts at the Fran&ccedil;ais could
not tempt.&nbsp; It would be difficult to overrate the influence
such an atmosphere, breathed in youth, must have on the taste and
character.&nbsp; The absence of a sordid spirit, the curse of our
material day and generation, the contact with intellects trained
to incase their thoughts in serried verse or crisp and lucid
prose, cannot but form the hearer&rsquo;s mind into a higher and
better mould.&nbsp; It is both a satisfaction and a hope for the
future to know that these influences are being felt all over the
capital and throughout the length and breadth of France.&nbsp;
There are at this moment in Paris alone three or four hundred
poets, ballad writers, and <i>raconteurs</i> who recite their
works in public.</p>
<p>It must be hard for the untravelled Anglo-Saxon to grasp the
idea that a poet can, without loss of prestige, recite his lines
in a public <i>caf&eacute;</i> before a mixed audience.&nbsp; If
such doubting souls could, however, be present at one of these
<i>noctes ambrosian&aelig;</i>, they would acknowledge that the
Latin temperament can throw a grace and child-like abandon around
an act that would cause an Englishman or an American to appear
supremely ridiculous.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s taste and sense of
fitness are never shocked.&nbsp; It seems the most natural thing
in the world to be sitting with your glass of beer before you,
while some rising poet, whose name ten years later may figure
among the &ldquo;Immortal Forty,&rdquo; tells to you his loves
and his ambition, or brings tears into your eyes with a
description of some humble hero or martyr.</p>
<p>From the days of Homer poetry has been the instructor of
nations.&nbsp; In the Orient to-day the poet story-teller holds
his audience spellbound for hours, teaching the people their
history and supplying their minds with food for thought, raising
them above the dull level of the brutes by the charm of his verse
and the elevation of his ideas.&nbsp; The power of poetry is the
same now as three thousand years ago.&nbsp; Modern skeptical
Paris, that scoffs at all creeds and chafes impatiently under any
rule, will sit to-day docile and complaisant, charmed by the
melody of a poet&rsquo;s voice; its passions lulled or quickened,
like Alexander&rsquo;s of old, at the will of a modern
Timotheus.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 17&mdash;Etiquette At Home and Abroad</h2>
<p>Reading that a sentinel had been punished the other day at St.
Petersburg for having omitted to present arms, as her Imperial
Highness, the Grand Duchess Olga, was leaving the winter
palace&mdash;in her nurse&rsquo;s arms&mdash;I smiled at what
appeared to be needless punctilio; then, as is my habit, began
turning the subject over, and gradually came to the conclusion
that while it could doubtless be well to suppress much of the
ceremonial encumbering court life, it might not be amiss if we
engrafted a little more etiquette into our intercourse with
strangers and the home relations.&nbsp; In our dear free and
easy-going country there is a constant tendency to loosen the
ties of fireside etiquette until any manners are thought good
enough, as any toilet is considered sufficiently attractive for
home use.&nbsp; A singular impression has grown up that formal
politeness and the saying of gracious and complimentary things
betray the toady and the hypocrite, both if whom are abhorrent to
Americans.</p>
<p>By the force of circumstances most people are civil enough in
general society; while many fail to keep to their high standard
in the intimacy of home life and in their intercourse with
inferiors, which is a pity, as these are the two cases where
self-restraint and amenity are most required.&nbsp; Politeness
is, after all, but the dictate of a kind heart, and supplies the
oil necessary to make the social machinery run smoothly.&nbsp; In
home life, which is the association during many hours each day of
people of varying dispositions, views, and occupations, friction
is inevitable; and there is especial need of lubrication to
lessen the wear and tear and eliminate jarring.</p>
<p>Americans are always much shocked to learn that we are not
popular on the Continent.&nbsp; Such a discovery comes to either
a nation or an individual like a douche of cold water on nice,
warm conceit, and brings with it a feeling of discouragement, of
being unjustly treated, that is painful, for we are very
&ldquo;touchy&rdquo; in America, and cry out when a foreigner
expresses anything but admiration for our ways, yet we are the
last to lend ourselves to foreign customs.</p>
<p>It has been a home thrust for many of us to find that our dear
friends the French sympathized warmly with Spain in the recent
struggle, and had little but sneers for us.&nbsp; One of the
reasons for this partiality is not hard to discover.</p>
<p>The Spanish who travel are mostly members of an aristocracy
celebrated for its grave courtesy, which has gone a long way
toward making them popular on the Continent, while we have for
years been riding rough-shod over the feelings and prejudices of
the European peoples, under the pleasing but fallacious illusion
that the money we spent so lavishly in foreign lands would atone
for all our sins.&nbsp; The large majority of our travelling
compatriots forget that an elaborate etiquette exists abroad
regulating the intercourse between one class and another, the
result of centuries of civilization, and as the Medic and Persian
laws for durability.&nbsp; In our ignorance we break many of
these social laws and give offence where none was intended.</p>
<p>A single illustration will explain my meaning.&nbsp; A young
American girl once went to the mistress of a <i>pension</i> where
she was staying and complained that the <i>concierge</i> of the
house had been impertinent.&nbsp; When the proprietress asked the
<i>concierge</i> what this meant, the latter burst out with her
wrongs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since Miss B. has been in this house, she
has never once bowed to me, or addressed a word to either my
husband or myself that was not a question or an order; she walks
in and out of my <i>loge</i> to look for letters or take her key
as though my room were the street; I won&rsquo;t stand such
treatment from any one, much less from a girl.&nbsp; The duchess
who lives <i>au quatri&egrave;me</i> never passes without a kind
word or an inquiry after the children or my health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this American girl had erred through ignorance of the fact
that in France servants are treated as humble friends.&nbsp; The
man who brings your matutinal coffee says &ldquo;Good
morning&rdquo; on entering the room, and inquires if
&ldquo;Monsieur has slept well,&rdquo; expecting to be treated
with the same politeness he shows to you.</p>
<p>The lady who sits at the <i>caisse</i> of the restaurant you
frequent is as sure of her position as her customers are of
theirs, and exacts a courteous salutation from every one entering
or leaving her presence; logically, for no gentleman would enter
a ladies&rsquo; drawing-room without removing his hat.&nbsp; The
fact that a woman is obliged to keep a shop in no way relieves
him of this obligation.</p>
<p>People on the Continent know their friends&rsquo; servants by
name, and speak to them on arriving at a house, and thank them
for an opened door or offered coat; if a tip is given it is
accompanied by a gracious word.&nbsp; So rare is this form of
civility in America and England (for Britons err as gravely in
this matter as ourselves) that our servants are surprised and
inclined to resent politeness, as in the case of an English
butler who recently came to his master and said he should be
&ldquo;obliged to leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; On being questioned it came
out that one of the guests was in the habit of chatting with him,
&ldquo;and,&rdquo; added the Briton, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand
being took liberties with by no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some years ago I happened to be standing in the vestibule of
the H&ocirc;tel Bristol as the Princess of Wales and her
daughters were leaving.&nbsp; Mr. Morlock, the proprietor, was at
the foot of the stairs to take leave of those ladies, who shook
hands with and thanked him for his attention during their stay,
and for the flowers he had sent.&nbsp; Nothing could have been
more gracious and freer from condescension than their manner, and
it undoubtedly produced the best impression.&nbsp; The waiter who
served me at that time was also under their charm, and remarked
several times that &ldquo;there had never been ladies so easy to
please or so considerate of the servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My neighbor at dinner the other evening confided to me that
she was &ldquo;worn out being fitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
such an unpleasant experience this morning,&rdquo; she
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>jupi&egrave;re</i> could not get one
of my skirts to hang properly.&nbsp; After a dozen attempts I
told her to send for the forewoman, when, to my horror, the girl
burst out crying, and said she should lose her place if I
did.&nbsp; I was very sorry for her, but what else could I
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; It does not seem as if that lady could be very
popular with inferiors, does it?</p>
<p>That it needs a lighter hand and more tact to deal with
tradespeople than with equals is certain, and we are sure to be
the losers when we fail.&nbsp; The last time I was in the East a
friend took me into the bazaars to see a carpet he was anxious to
buy.&nbsp; The price asked was out of all proportion to its
value, but we were gravely invited by the merchant to be seated
and coffee was served, that bargaining (which is the backbone of
Oriental trade) might be carried on at leisure.&nbsp; My friend,
nervous and impatient, like all our race, turned to me and said,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this tomfoolery?&nbsp; Tell him
I&rsquo;ll give so much for his carpet; he can take it or leave
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; When this was interpreted to the bearded
tradesman, he smiled and came down a few dollars in his price,
and ordered more coffee.&nbsp; By this time we were outside his
shop, and left without the carpet simply because my friend could
not conform to the customs of the country he was visiting.&nbsp;
The sale of his carpet was a big affair for the Oriental; he
intended to carry it through with all the ceremony the occasion
required, and would sooner not make a sale than be hustled out of
his stately routine.</p>
<p>It is not only in intercourse with inferiors that tact is
required.&nbsp; The treatment of children and young people in a
family calls for delicate handling.&nbsp; The habit of taking
liberties with young relations is a common form of a relaxed
social code and the besetting sin of elderly people, who, having
little to interest them in their own lives, imagine that their
mission is to reform the ways and manners of their family.&nbsp;
Ensconced behind the respect which the young are supposed to pay
them, they give free vent to inclination, and carp, cavil, and
correct.&nbsp; The victims may have reached maturity or even
middle age, but remain always children to these social policemen,
to be reproved and instructed in and out of season.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am doing this for your own good,&rdquo; is an excuse
that apparently frees the veterans from the necessity of
respecting the prejudices and feelings of their pupils, and lends
a gloss of unselfishness to actions which are simply
impertinent.&nbsp; Oddly enough, amateur
&ldquo;schoolmarms&rdquo; who fall into this unpleasant habit are
generally oversensitive, and resent as a personal affront any
restlessness under criticism on the part of their victims.&nbsp;
It is easy, once the habit is acquired, to carry the suavity and
consideration of general society into the home circle, yet how
often is it done?&nbsp; I should like to see the principle that
ordered presentation of arms to the infant princess applied to
our intimate relations, and the rights of the young and dependent
scrupulously respected.</p>
<p>In the third act of <i>Caste</i>, when old Eccles steals the
&ldquo;coral&rdquo; from his grandson&rsquo;s neck, he excuses
the theft by a grandiloquent soliloquy, and persuades himself
that he is protecting &ldquo;the weak and the humble&rdquo;
(pointing to himself) &ldquo;against the powerful and the
strong&rdquo; (pointing to the baby).&nbsp; Alas, too many of us
take liberties with those whom we do not fear, and excuse our
little acts of cowardice with arguments as fallacious as those of
drunken old Eccles.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 18&mdash;What is &ldquo;Art&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>In former years, we inquiring youngsters in foreign studios
were much bewildered by the repetition of a certain phrase.&nbsp;
Discussion of almost any picture or statue was (after other forms
of criticism had been exhausted) pretty sure to conclude with,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well in its way, but it&rsquo;s not
Art.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only foolish youths but the
&ldquo;masters&rdquo; themselves constantly advanced this opinion
to crush a rival or belittle a friend.&nbsp; To ardent minds
seeking for the light and catching at every thread that might
serve as a guide out of perplexity, this vague assertion was
confusing.&nbsp; According to one master, the eighteenth-century
&ldquo;school&rdquo; did not exist.&nbsp; What had been produced
at that time was pleasing enough to the eye, but &ldquo;was not
Art!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the opinion of another, Italian music might
amuse or cheer the ignorant, but could not be recognized by
serious musicians.</p>
<p>As most of us were living far from home and friends for the
purpose of acquiring the rudiments of art, this continual
sweeping away of our foundations was discouraging.&nbsp; What was
the use, we sometimes asked ourselves, of toiling, if our work
was to be cast contemptuously aside by the next
&ldquo;school&rdquo; as a pleasing trifle, not for a moment to be
taken seriously?&nbsp; How was one to find out the truth?&nbsp;
Who was to decide when doctors disagreed?&nbsp; Where was the
rock on which an earnest student might lay his cornerstone
without the misgiving that the next wave in public opinion would
sap its base and cast him and his ideals out again at sea?</p>
<p>The eighteenth-century artists and the Italian composers had
been sincere and convinced that they were producing works of
art.&nbsp; In our own day the idol of one moment becomes the jest
of the next.&nbsp; Was there, then, no fixed law?</p>
<p>The short period, for instance, between 1875 and the present
time has been long enough for the talent of one painter
(Bastien-Lepage) to be discovered, discussed, lauded, acclaimed,
then gradually forgotten and decried.&nbsp; During the years when
we were studying in Paris, that young painter&rsquo;s works were
pronounced by the critics and their following to be the last
development of Art.&nbsp; Museums and amateurs vied with each
other in acquiring his canvases.&nbsp; Yet, only this spring,
while dining with two or three art critics in the French capital,
I heard Lepage&rsquo;s name mentioned and his works recalled with
the smile that is accorded to those who have hoodwinked the
public and passed off spurious material as the real thing.</p>
<p>If any one doubts the fleeting nature of a reputation, let him
go to a sale of modern pictures and note the prices brought by
the favorites of twenty years ago.&nbsp; The paintings of that
arch-priest, Meissonier, no longer command the sums that eager
collectors paid for them a score of years back.&nbsp; When a
great European critic dares assert, as one has recently, of the
master&rsquo;s &ldquo;1815,&rdquo; that &ldquo;everything in the
picture appears metallic, except the cannon and the men&rsquo;s
helmets,&rdquo; the mighty are indeed fallen!&nbsp; It is much
the same thing with the old masters.&nbsp; There have been
fashions in them as in other forms of art.&nbsp; Fifty years ago
Rembrandt&rsquo;s work brought but small prices, and until Henri
Rochefort (during his exile) began to write up the English
school, Romneys, Lawrences, and Gainsboroughs had little market
value.</p>
<p>The result is that most of us are as far away from the
solution of that vexed question &ldquo;What is Art?&rdquo; at
forty as we were when boys.&nbsp; The majority have arranged a
compromise with their consciences.&nbsp; We have found out what
we like (in itself no mean achievement), and beyond such personal
preference, are shy of asserting (as we were fond of doing
formerly) that such and such works are &ldquo;Art,&rdquo; and
such others, while pleasing and popular, lack the requisite
qualities.</p>
<p>To enquiring minds, sure that an answer to this question
exists, but uncertain where to look for it, the fact that one of
the thinkers of the century has, in a recent
&ldquo;Evangel,&rdquo; given to the world a definition of
&ldquo;Art,&rdquo; the result of many years&rsquo; meditation,
will be received with joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art,&rdquo; says Tolstoi,
&ldquo;is simply a condition of life.&nbsp; It is any form of
expression that a human being employs to communicate an emotion
he has experienced to a fellow-mortal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An author who, in telling his hopes and sorrows, amuses or
saddens a reader, has in just so much produced a work of
art.&nbsp; A lover who, by the sincerity of his accent,
communicates the flame that is consuming him to the object of his
adoration; the shopkeeper who inspires a purchaser with his own
admiration for an object on sale; the baby that makes its joy
known to a parent&mdash;artists! artists!&nbsp; Brown, Jones, or
Robinson, the moment he has consciously produced on a
neighbor&rsquo;s ear or eye the sensation that a sound or a
combination of colors has effected on his own organs, is an
artist!</p>
<p>Of course much of this has been recognized through all
time.&nbsp; The formula in which Tolstoi has presented his
meditations to the world is, however, so fresh that it comes like
a revelation, with the additional merit of being understood, with
little or no mental effort, by either the casual reader, who,
with half-attention attracted by a headline, says to himself,
&ldquo;&lsquo;What is art?&rsquo;&nbsp; That looks
interesting!&rdquo; and skims lightly down the lines, or the
thinker who, after perusing Tolstoi&rsquo;s lucid words, lays
down the volume with a sigh, and murmurs in his humiliation,
&ldquo;Why have I been all these years seeking in the clouds for
what was lying ready at my hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wide-reaching definition of the Russian writer has the
effect of a vigorous blow from a pickaxe at the foundations of a
shaky and too elaborate edifice.&nbsp; The wordy superstructure
of aphorisms and paradox falls to the ground, disclosing fair
&ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; so long a captive within the temple erected
in her honor.&nbsp; As, however, the newly freed goddess smiles
on the ignorant and the pedants alike, the result is that with
one accord the &aelig;sthetes raise a howl!&nbsp; &ldquo;And the
&lsquo;beautiful,&rsquo;&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;the
beautiful?&nbsp; Can there be any &lsquo;Art&rsquo; without the
&lsquo;Beautiful&rsquo;?&nbsp; What! the little greengrocer at
the corner is an artist because, forsooth, he has arranged some
lettuce and tomatoes into a tempting pile!&nbsp; Anathema!&nbsp;
Art is a secret known only to the initiated few; the vulgar can
neither understand nor appreciate it!&nbsp; We are the
elect!&nbsp; Our mission is to explain what Art is and point out
her beauty to a coarse and heedless world.&nbsp; Only those with
a sense of the &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; should be allowed to enter
into her sacred presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the expounders of &ldquo;Art&rdquo; plunge into a sea of
words, offering a dozen definitions each more obscure than its
predecessor, all of which have served in turn as watchwords of
different &ldquo;schools.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tolstoi&rsquo;s sweeping
truth is too far-reaching to please these gentry.&nbsp; Like the
priests of past religions, they would have preferred to keep such
knowledge as they had to themselves and expound it, little at a
time, to the ignorant.&nbsp; The great Russian has kicked away
their altar and routed the false gods, whose acolytes will never
forgive him.</p>
<p>Those of my readers who have been intimate with painters,
actors, or musicians, will recall with amusement how lightly the
performances of an associate are condemned by the brotherhood as
falling short of the high standard which according to these
wiseacres, &ldquo;Art&rdquo; exacts, and how sure each speaker is
of understanding just where a brother carries his
&ldquo;mote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voltaire once avoided giving a definition of the beautiful by
saying, &ldquo;Ask a toad what his ideas of beauty are.&nbsp; He
will indicate the particular female toad he happens to admire and
praise her goggle-eyes and yellow belly as the perfection of
beauty!&rdquo;&nbsp; A negro from Guiana will make much the same
unsatisfactory answer, so the old philosopher recommends us not
to be didactic on subjects where judgments are relative, and at
the same time without appeal.</p>
<p>Tolstoi denies that an idea as subtle as a definition of Art
can be classified by pedants, and proceeds to formulate the
following delightful axiom: &ldquo;A principle upon which no two
people can agree does not exist.&rdquo;&nbsp; A truth is proved
by its evidence to all.&nbsp; Discussion outside of that is
simply beating the air.&nbsp; Each succeeding
&ldquo;school&rdquo; has sounded its death-knell by asserting
that certain combinations alone produced beauty&mdash;the
weakness of to-day being an inclination to see art only in the
obscure and the recondite.&nbsp; As a result we drift each hour
further from the truth.&nbsp; Modern intellectuality has formed
itself into a scornful aristocracy whose members, esteeming
themselves the &eacute;lite, withdraw from the vulgar public, and
live in a world of their own, looking (like the Lady of Shalott)
into a mirror at distorted images of nature and declaring that
what they see is art!</p>
<p>In literature that which is difficult to understand is much
admired by the simple-minded, who also decry pictures that tell
their own story!&nbsp; A certain class of minds enjoy being
mystified, and in consequence writers, painters, and musicians
have appeared who are willing to juggle for their
amusement.&nbsp; The simple definition given to us by the Russian
writer comes like a breath of wholesome air to those suffocating
in an atmosphere of perfumes and artificial heat.&nbsp; Art is
our common inheritance, not the property of a favored few.&nbsp;
The wide world we love is full of it, and each of us in his
humble way is an artist when with a full heart he communicates
his delight and his joy to another.&nbsp; Tolstoi has given us
back our birthright, so long withheld, and crowned with his aged
hands the true artist.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 19&mdash;The Genealogical Craze</h2>
<p>There undoubtedly is something in the American temperament
that prevents our doing anything in moderation.&nbsp; If we take
up an idea, it is immediately run to exaggeration and then
abandoned, that the nation may fly at a tangent after some new
fad.&nbsp; Does this come from our climate, or (as I am inclined
to think) from the curiously unclassified state of society in our
country, where so few established standards exist and so few are
sure of their own or their neighbors&rsquo; standing?&nbsp; In
consequence, if Mrs. Brown starts anything, Mrs. Jones, for fear
of being left behind, immediately &ldquo;goes her one
better&rdquo; to be in turn &ldquo;raised&rdquo; by Mrs.
Robinson.</p>
<p>In other lands a reasonable pride of birth has always been one
of the bonds holding communities together, and is estimated at
its just value.&nbsp; We, after having practically ignored the
subject for half a century, suddenly rush to the other extreme,
and develop an entire forest of genealogical trees at a
growth.</p>
<p>Chagrined, probably, at the small amount of consideration that
their superior birth commanded, a number of aristocratically
minded matrons united a few years ago as &ldquo;Daughters of the
Revolution,&rdquo; restricting membership to women descended from
officers of Washington&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; There may have been a
reason for the formation of this society.&nbsp; I say
&ldquo;may&rdquo; because it does not seem quite clear what its
aim was.&nbsp; The originators doubtless imagined they were
founding an exclusive circle, but the numbers who clamored for
admittance quickly dispelled this illusion.&nbsp; So a small
group of the elect withdrew in disgust and banded together under
the cognomen of &ldquo;Colonial Dames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only result of these two movements was to awaken envy,
hatred, and malice in the hearts of those excluded from the
mysterious rites, which to outsiders seemed to consist in
blackballing as many aspirants as possible.&nbsp; Some victims of
this bad treatment, thirsting for revenge, struck on the happy
thought of inaugurating an &ldquo;Aztec&rdquo; society.&nbsp; As
that title conveyed absolutely no idea to any one, its members
were forced to explain that only descendants of officers who
fought in the Mexican War were eligible.&nbsp; What the elect did
when they got into the circle was not specified.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Social Order of Foreign Wars&rdquo; was the next
creation, its authors evidently considering the Mexican campaign
as a domestic article, a sort of family squabble.&nbsp; Then the
&ldquo;Children of 1812&rdquo; attracted attention, both groups
having immediate success.&nbsp; Indeed, the vogue of these
enterprises has been in inverse ratio to their usefulness or
<i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, people apparently being ready
to join anything rather than get left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Jealous probably of seeing women enjoying all the fun, their
husbands and brothers next banded together as &ldquo;Sons of the
Revolution.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wives retaliated by instituting the
&ldquo;Granddaughters of the Revolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Mayflower Order,&rdquo; the &ldquo;price of admission&rdquo; to
the latter being descent from some one who crossed in that
celebrated ship&mdash;whether as one of the crew or as passenger
is not clear.</p>
<p>It was not, however, in the American temperament to rest
content with modest beginnings, the national motto being,
&ldquo;The best is good enough for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So wind was
quickly taken out of the Mayflower&rsquo;s sails by &ldquo;The
Royal Order of the Crown,&rdquo; to which none need apply who
were not prepared to prove descent from one or more royal
ancestors.&nbsp; It was not stated in the prospectus whether
Irish sovereigns and Fiji Island kings counted, but I have been
told that bar sinisters form a class apart, and are deprived of
the right to vote or hold office.</p>
<p>Descent from any old king was, however, not sufficient for the
high-toned people of our republic.&nbsp; When you come to think
of it, such a circle might be &ldquo;mixed.&rdquo; One really
must draw the line somewhere (as the Boston parvenu replied when
asked why he had not invited his brother to a ball).&nbsp; So the
founders of the &ldquo;Circle of Holland Dames of the New
Netherlands&rdquo; drew the line at descent from a sovereign of
the Low Countries.&nbsp; It does not seem as if this could be a
large society, although those old Dutch pashas had an
unconscionable number of children.</p>
<p>The promoters of this enterprise seem nevertheless to have
been fairly successful, for they gave a f&ecirc;te recently and
crowned a queen.&nbsp; To be acclaimed their sovereign by a group
of people all of royal birth is indeed an honor.&nbsp; Rumors of
this ceremony have come to us outsiders.&nbsp; It is said that
they employed only lineal descendants of Vatel to prepare their
banquet, and I am assured that an offspring of Gambrinus acted as
butler.</p>
<p>But it is wrong to joke on this subject.&nbsp; The state of
affairs is becoming too serious.&nbsp; When sane human beings
form a &ldquo;Baronial Order of Runnymede,&rdquo; and announce in
their prospectus that only descendants through the male line from
one (or more) of the forty noblemen who forced King John to sign
the Magna Charta are what our Washington Mrs. Malaprop would call
&ldquo;legible,&rdquo; the action attests a diseased condition of
the community.&nbsp; Any one taking the trouble to remember that
eight of the original barons died childless, and that the Wars of
the Roses swept away nine tenths of what families the others may
have had, that only one man in England (Lord de Ros) can at the
present day <i>prove</i> male descent further back than the
eleventh century, must appreciate the absurdity of our
compatriots&rsquo; pretensions.&nbsp; Burke&rsquo;s Peerage is
acknowledged to be the most &ldquo;faked&rdquo; volume in the
English language, but the descents it attributes are like
mathematical demonstrations compared to the &ldquo;trees&rdquo;
that members of these new American orders climb.</p>
<p>When my class was graduated from Mr. McMullen&rsquo;s school,
we little boys had the brilliant idea of uniting in a society,
but were greatly put about for an effective name, hitting finally
upon that of Ancient Seniors&rsquo; Society.&nbsp; For a group of
infants, this must be acknowledged to have been a luminous
inspiration.&nbsp; We had no valid reason for forming that
society, not being particularly fond of each other.&nbsp; Living
in several cities, we rarely met after leaving school and had
little to say to each other when we did.&nbsp; But it sounded so
fine to be an &ldquo;Ancient Senior,&rdquo; and we hoped in our
next school to impress new companions with that title and make
them feel proper respect for us in consequence.&nbsp; Pride,
however, sustained a fall when it was pointed out that the
initials formed the ominous word &ldquo;Ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have a shrewd suspicion that the motives which prompted our
youthful actions are not very different from those now inciting
children of a larger growth to band together, blackball their
friends, crown queens, and perform other senseless mummeries,
such as having the weathercock of a departed meeting-house
brought in during a banquet, and dressing restaurant waiters in
knickerbockers for &ldquo;one night only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This malarial condition of our social atmosphere accounts for
the quantity of genealogical quacks that have taken to sending
typewritten letters, stating that the interest they take in your
private affairs compels them to offer proof of your descent from
any crowned head to whom you may have taken a fancy.&nbsp; One
correspondent assured me only this month that he had papers in
his possession showing beyond a doubt that I might claim a
certain King McDougal of Scotland for an ancestor.&nbsp; I have
misgivings, however, as to the quality of the royal blood in my
veins, for the same correspondent was equally confident six
months ago that my people came in direct line from
Charlemagne.&nbsp; As I have no desire to &ldquo;corner&rdquo;
the market in kings, these letters have remained unanswered.</p>
<p>Considering the mania to trace descent from illustrious men,
it astonishes me that a Mystic Band, consisting of lineal
descendants from the Seven Sages of Greece, has not before now
burst upon an astonished world.&nbsp; It has been suggested that
if some one wanted to organize a truly restricted circle,
&ldquo;The Grandchildren of our Tripoli War&rdquo; would be an
excellent title.&nbsp; So few Americans took part in that
conflict&mdash;and still fewer know anything about it&mdash;that
the satisfaction of joining the society would be immense to
exclusively-minded people.</p>
<p>There is only one explanation that seems in any way to account
for this vast tomfoolery.&nbsp; A little sentence, printed at the
bottom of a prospectus recently sent to me, lets the ambitious
cat out of the genealogical bag.&nbsp; It states that
&ldquo;social position is assured to people joining our
order.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thanks to the idiotic habit some newspapers
have inaugurated of advertising, gratis, a number of self-elected
society &ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; many feeble-minded people, with
more ambition than cash, and a larger supply of family papers
than brains, have been bitten with a social madness, and enter
these traps, thinking they are the road to position and
honors.&nbsp; The number of fools is larger than one would have
believed possible, if the success of so many
&ldquo;orders,&rdquo; &ldquo;circles,&rdquo;
&ldquo;commanderies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;regencies&rdquo; were not
there to testify to the unending folly of the would-be
&ldquo;smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last decade of the century has brought to light many
strange fads and senseless manias.&nbsp; This
&ldquo;descent&rdquo; craze, however, surpasses them all in
inanity.&nbsp; The keepers of insane asylums will tell you that
one of the hopeless forms of madness is <i>la folie des
grandeurs</i>.&nbsp; A breath of this delirium seems to be
blowing over our country.&nbsp; Crowns and sceptres haunt the
dreams of simple republican men and women, troubling their
slumbers and leading them a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp dance back
across the centuries.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 20&mdash;As the Twig is Bent</h2>
<p>I knew, in my youth, a French village far up among the
Cevennes Mountains, where the one cultivated man of the place,
saddened by the unlovely lives of the peasants around him and by
the bare walls of the village school, organized evening classes
for the boys.&nbsp; During these informal hours, he talked to
them of literature and art and showed them his prints and
paintings.&nbsp; When the youths&rsquo; interest was aroused he
lent them books, that they might read about the statues and
buildings that had attracted their attention.&nbsp; At first it
appeared a hopeless task to arouse any interest among these
peasants in subjects not bearing on their abject lives.&nbsp; To
talk with boys of the ideal, when their poor bodies were in need
of food and raiment, seemed superfluous; but in time the charm
worked, as it always will.&nbsp; The beautiful appealed to their
simple natures, elevating and refining them, and opening before
their eager eyes perspectives of undreamed-of interest.&nbsp; The
self-imposed task became a delight as his pupils&rsquo; minds
responded to his efforts.&nbsp; Although death soon ended his
useful life, the seed planted grew and bore fruit in many humble
homes.</p>
<p>At this moment I know men in several walks of life who revere
with touching devotion the memory of the one human being who had
brought to them, at the moment when they were most
impressionable, the gracious message that existence was not
merely a struggle for bread.&nbsp; The boys he had gathered
around him realize now that the encouragement and incentive
received from those evening glimpses of noble works existing in
the world was the mainspring of their subsequent development and
a source of infinite pleasure through all succeeding years.</p>
<p>This reference to an individual effort toward cultivating the
poor has been made because other delicate spirits are attempting
some such task in our city, where quite as much as in the French
village schoolchildren stand in need of some message of beauty in
addition to the instruction they receive,&mdash;some window
opened for them, as it were, upon the fields of art, that their
eyes when raised from study or play may rest on objects more
inspiring than blank walls and the graceless surroundings of
street or schoolroom.</p>
<p>We are far too quick in assuming that love of the beautiful is
confined to the highly educated; that the poor have no desire to
surround themselves with graceful forms and harmonious
colors.&nbsp; We wonder at and deplore their crude standards,
bewailing the general lack of taste and the gradual reducing of
everything to a commonplace money basis.&nbsp; We smile at the
efforts toward adornment attempted by the poor, taking it too
readily for granted that on this point they are beyond
redemption.&nbsp; This error is the less excusable as so little
has been done by way of experiment before forming an
opinion,&mdash;whole classes being put down as inferior beings,
incapable of appreciation, before they have been allowed even a
glimpse of the works of art that form the daily mental food of
their judges.</p>
<p>The portly charlady who rules despotically in my chambers is
an example.&nbsp; It has been a curious study to watch her
growing interest in the objects that have here for the first time
come under her notice; the delight she has come to take in
dusting and arranging my belongings, and her enthusiasm at any
new acquisition.&nbsp; Knowing how bare her own home was, I felt
at first only astonishment at her vivid interest in what seemed
beyond her comprehension, but now realize that in some blind way
she appreciates the rare and the delicate quite as much as my
more cultivated visitors.&nbsp; At the end of one laborious
morning, when everything was arranged to her satisfaction, she
turned to me her poor, plain face, lighted up with an expression
of delight, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, sir, I do love to work in
these rooms!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m never so happy as when I&rsquo;m
arranging them elegant things!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, although my
pleasure in her pleasure was modified by the discovery that she
had taken an eighteenth-century comb to disentangle the fringes
of a rug, and broken several of its teeth in her ardor, that she
invariably placed a certain Whister etching upside down, and then
stood in rapt admiration before it, still, in watching her
enthusiasm, I felt a thrill of satisfaction at seeing how her
untaught taste responded to a contact with good things.</p>
<p>Here in America, and especially in our city, which we have
been at such pains to make as hideous as possible, the
schoolrooms, where hundreds of thousands of children pass many
hours daily, are one degree more graceless than the town itself;
the most artistically inclined child can hardly receive any but
unfortunate impressions.&nbsp; The other day a friend took me
severely to task for rating our American women on their love of
the big shops, and gave me, I confess, an entirely new idea on
the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;that the shops here are what the museums abroad are to the
poor?&nbsp; It is in them only that certain people may catch
glimpses of the dainty and exquisite manufactures of other
countries.&nbsp; The little education their eyes receive is
obtained during visits to these emporiums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this proves so, and it seems probable, it only proves how
the humble long for something more graceful than their meagre
homes afford.</p>
<p>In the hope of training the younger generations to better
standards and less vulgar ideals, a group of ladies are making an
attempt to surround our schoolchildren during their
impressionable youth with reproductions of historic masterpieces,
and have already decorated many schoolrooms in this way.&nbsp;
For a modest sum it is possible to tint the bare walls an
attractive color&mdash;a delight in itself&mdash;and adorn them
with plaster casts of statues and solar prints of pictures and
buildings.&nbsp; The transformation that fifty or sixty dollars
judiciously expended in this way produces in a schoolroom is
beyond belief, and, as the advertisements say, &ldquo;must be
seen to be appreciated,&rdquo; giving an air of cheerfulness and
refinement to the dreariest apartment.</p>
<p>It is hard to make people understand the enthusiasm these
decorations have excited in both teachers and pupils.&nbsp; The
directress of one of our large schools was telling me of the help
and pleasure the prints and casts had been to her; she had given
them as subjects for the class compositions, and used them in a
hundred different ways as object-lessons.&nbsp; As the children
are graduated from room to room, a great variety of high-class
subjects can be brought to their notice by varying the
decorations.</p>
<p>It is by the eye principally that taste is educated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We speak with admiration of the eighth sense common among
Parisians, and envy them their magic power of combining simple
materials into an artistic whole.&nbsp; The reason is that for
generations the eyes of those people have been unconsciously
educated by the harmonious lines of well-proportioned buildings,
finely finished detail of stately colonnade, and shady
perspective of quay and boulevard.&nbsp; After years of this
subtle training the eye instinctively revolts from the vulgar and
the crude.&nbsp; There is little in the poorer quarters of our
city to rejoice or refine the senses; squalor and all-pervading
ugliness are not least among the curses that poverty entails.</p>
<p>If you have a subject of interest in your mind, it often
happens that every book you open, every person you speak with,
refers to that topic.&nbsp; I never remember having seen an
explanation offered of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The other morning, while this article was lying half finished
on my desk, I opened the last number of a Paris paper and began
reading an account of the drama, <i>Les Mauvais Bergers</i>
(treating of that perilous subject, the &ldquo;strikes&rdquo;),
which Sarah Bernhardt had just had the courage to produce before
the Paris public.&nbsp; In the third act, when the owner of the
factory receives the disaffected hands, and listens to their
complaints, the leader of the strike (an intelligent young
workman), besides shorter hours and increased pay, demands that
recreation rooms be built where the toilers, their wives, and
their children may pass unoccupied hours in the enjoyment of
attractive surroundings, and cries in conclusion: &ldquo;We, the
poor, need some poetry and some art in our lives, man does not
live by bread alone.&nbsp; He has a right, like the rich, to
things of beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In commending the use of decoration as a means of bringing
pleasure into dull, cramped lives, one is too often met by the
curious argument that taste is innate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Either people
have it or they haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; like a long nose or a short
one, and it is useless to waste good money in trying to improve
either.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be much more to the point to spend
your money in giving the poor children a good roast-beef dinner
at Christmas than in placing the bust of Clytie before
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; That argument has crushed more attempts to
elevate the poor than any other ever advanced.&nbsp; If it were
listened to, there would never be any progress made, because
there are always thousands of people who are hungry.</p>
<p>When we reflect how painfully ill-arranged rooms or ugly
colors affect our senses, and remember that less fortunate
neighbors suffer as much as we do from hideous environments, it
seems like keeping sunlight from a plant, or fresh air out of a
sick-room, to refuse glimpses of the beautiful to the poor when
it is in our power to give them this satisfaction with a slight
effort.&nbsp; Nothing can be more encouraging to those who
occasionally despair of human nature than the good results
already obtained by this small attempt in the schools.</p>
<p>We fall into the error of imagining that because the Apollo
Belvedere and the Square of St. Mark&rsquo;s have become stale to
us by reproduction they are necessarily so to others.&nbsp; The
great and the wealthy of the world form no idea of the longing
the poor feel for a little variety in their lives.&nbsp; They do
not know what they want.&nbsp; They have no standards to guide
them, but the desire is there.&nbsp; Let us offer ourselves the
satisfaction, as we start off for pleasure trips abroad or to the
mountains, of knowing that at home the routine of study is
lightened for thousands of children by the counterfeit
presentment of the scenes we are enjoying; that, as we float up
the Golden Horn or sit in the moonlight by the Parthenon, far
away at home some child is dreaming of those fair scenes as she
raises her eyes from her task, and is unconsciously imbibing a
love of the beautiful, which will add a charm to her humble life,
and make the present labors lighter.&nbsp; If the child never
lives to see the originals, she will be happier for knowing that
somewhere in the world domed mosques mirror themselves in still
waters, and marble gods, the handiwork of long-dead nations,
stand in the golden sunlight and silently preach the gospel of
the beautiful.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 21&mdash;Seven Small Duchesses</h2>
<p>Since those &ldquo;precious&rdquo; days when the
habitu&eacute;s of the H&ocirc;tel Rambouillet first raised
social intercourse to the level of a fine art, the morals and
manners, the amusements and intrigues of great French ladies have
interested the world and influenced the ways of civilized
nations.&nbsp; Thanks to Memoirs and Maxims, we are able to
reconstruct the life of a seventeenth or eighteenth century
noblewoman as completely as German archeologists have rebuilt the
temple of the Wingless Victory on the Acropolis from surrounding
d&eacute;bris.</p>
<p>Interest in French society has, however, diminished during
this century, ceasing almost entirely with the Second Empire,
when foreign women gave the tone to a parvenu court from which
the older aristocracy held aloof in disgust behind the closed
gates of their &ldquo;h&ocirc;tels&rdquo; and historic
ch&acirc;teaux.</p>
<p>With the exception of Balzac, few writers have drawn authentic
pictures of nineteenth-century noblewomen in France; and his
vivid portrayals are more the creations of genius than correct
descriptions of a caste.</p>
<p>During the last fifty years French aristocrats have ceased to
be factors even in matters social, the sceptre they once held
having passed into alien hands, the daughters of Albion to a
great extent replacing their French rivals in influencing the
ways of the &ldquo;world,&rdquo;&mdash;a change, be it remarked
in passing, that has not improved the tone of society or
contributed to the spread of good manners.</p>
<p>People like the French nobles, engaged in sulking and
attempting to overthrow or boycott each succeeding r&eacute;gime,
must naturally lose their influence.&nbsp; They have held aloof
so long&mdash;fearing to compromise themselves by any advances to
the powers that be, and restrained by countless traditions from
taking an active part in either the social or political
strife&mdash;that little by little they have been passed by and
ignored; which is a pity, for amid the ruin of many hopes and
ambitions they have remained true to their caste and handed down
from generation to generation the secret of that gracious
urbanity and tact which distinguished the Gallic noblewoman in
the last century from the rest of her kind and made her so deft
in the difficult art of pleasing&mdash;and being pleased.</p>
<p>Within the last few years there have, however, been signs of a
change.&nbsp; Young members of historic houses show an amusing
inclination to escape from their austere surroundings and resume
the place their grandparents abdicated.&nbsp; If it is impossible
to rule as formerly, they at any rate intend to get some fun out
of existence.</p>
<p>This joyous movement to the front is being made by the young
matrons enlisted under the &ldquo;Seven little
duchesses&rsquo;&rdquo; banner.&nbsp; Oddly enough, a
baker&rsquo;s half-dozen of ducal coronets are worn at this
moment, in France, by small and sprightly women, who have shaken
the dust of centuries from those ornaments and sport them with a
decidedly modern air!</p>
<p>It is the members of this clique who, in Paris during the
spring, at their ch&acirc;teaux in the summer and autumn, and on
the Riviera after Christmas, lead the amusements and strike the
key for the modern French world.</p>
<p>No one of these light-hearted ladies takes any particular
precedence over the others.&nbsp; All are young, and some are
wonderfully nice to look at.&nbsp; The Duchesse
d&rsquo;Uz&egrave;s is, perhaps, the handsomest, good looks being
an inheritance from her mother, the beautiful and wayward
Duchesse de Chaulme.</p>
<p>There is a vivid grace about the daughter, an intense vitality
that suggests some beautiful being of the forest.&nbsp; As she
moves and speaks one almost expects to hear the quick breath
coming and going through her quivering nostrils, and see foam on
her full lips.&nbsp; Her mother&rsquo;s tragic death has thrown a
glamor of romance around the daughter&rsquo;s life that heightens
the witchery of her beauty.</p>
<p>Next in good looks comes an American, the Duchesse de la
Rochefoucauld, although marriage (which, as de Maupassant
remarked, is rarely becoming) has not been propitious to that
gentle lady.&nbsp; By rights she should have been mentioned
first, as her husband outranks, not only all the men of his age,
but also his cousin, the old Duc de la
Rochefoucauld-Doudeauville, to whom, however, a sort of brevet
rank is accorded on account of his years, his wealth, and the
high rank of his two wives.&nbsp; It might almost be asserted
that our fair compatriot wears the oldest coronet in
France.&nbsp; She certainly is mistress of three of the finest
ch&acirc;teaux in that country, among which is Miromail, where
the family live, and Liancourt, a superb Renaissance structure, a
delight to the artist&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>The young Duchesse de Brissac runs her two comrades close as
regards looks.&nbsp; Brissac is the son of Mme. de
Tr&eacute;dern, whom Newporters will remember two years ago, when
she enjoyed some weeks of our summer season.&nbsp; Their
ch&acirc;teau was built by the Brissac of Henri IV.&rsquo;s time
and is one of the few that escaped uninjured through the
Revolution, its vast stone corridors and massive oak ceilings,
its moat and battlements, standing to-day unimpaired amid a group
of ch&acirc;teaux including Chaumont, Rochecotte, Azay-le-Rideau,
Uss&eacute;, Chenonceau, within &ldquo;dining&rdquo; distance of
each other, that form a centre of gayety next in importance to
Paris and Cannes.&nbsp; In the autumn these spacious castles are
filled with joyous bands and their ample stables with
horses.&nbsp; A couple of years ago, when the king of Portugal
and his suite were entertained at Chaumont for a week of
stag-hunting, over three hundred people, servants, and guests,
slept under its roof, and two hundred horses were housed in its
stables.</p>
<p>The Duc de Luynes and his wife, who was Mlle. de Crussol
(daughter of the brilliant Duchesse d&rsquo;Uz&egrave;s of
Boulanger fame), live at Dampierre, another interesting pile
filled with rare pictures, bric-&agrave;-brac, and statuary,
first among which is Jean Goujon&rsquo;s life-sized statue (in
silver) of Louis XIII., presented by that monarch to his
favorite, the founder of the house.&nbsp; This gem of the
Renaissance stands in an octagonal chamber hung in dark velvet,
unique among statues.&nbsp; It has been shown but once in public,
at the Loan Exhibition in 1872, when the patriotic nobility lent
their treasures to collect a fund for the Alsace-Lorraine
exiles.</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Noailles, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mlle. de Luynes,
is another of this coterie and one of the few French noblewomen
who has travelled.&nbsp; Many Americans will remember the visit
she made here with her mother some years ago, and the effect her
girlish grace produced at that time.&nbsp; The de Noailles&rsquo;
ch&acirc;teau of Maintenon is an inheritance from Louis
XIV.&rsquo;s prudish favorite, who founded and enriched the de
Noailles family.&nbsp; The Duc and Duchesse d&rsquo;Uz&egrave;s
live near by at Bonnelle with the old Duc de Doudeauville, her
grandfather, who is also the grandfather of Mme. de Noailles,
these two ladies being descended each from a wife of the old
duke, the former from the Princesse de Polignac and the latter
from the Princesse de Ligne.</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Bisaccia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Princesse
Radziwill, and the Duchesse d&rsquo;Harcourt, who complete the
circle of seven, also live in this vicinity, where another group
of historic residences, including Eclimont and Rambouillet, the
summer home of the president, rivals in gayety and hospitality
the ch&acirc;teaux of the Loire.</p>
<p>No coterie in England or in this country corresponds at all to
this French community.&nbsp; Much as they love to amuse
themselves, the idea of meeting any but their own set has never
passed through their well-dressed heads.&nbsp; They differ from
their parents in that they have broken away from many antiquated
habits.&nbsp; Their houses are no longer lay hermitages, and
their opera boxes are regularly filled, but no foreigner is ever
received, no ambitious parvenu accepted among them.&nbsp;
Ostracism here means not a ten years&rsquo; exile, but lifelong
banishment.</p>
<p>The contrast is strong between this rigor and the enthusiasm
with which wealthy new-comers are welcomed into London society or
by our own upper crust, so full of unpalatable pieces of
dough.&nbsp; This exclusiveness of the titled French reminds
me&mdash;incongruously enough&mdash;of a certain arrangement of
graves in a Lenox cemetery, where the members of an old New
England family lie buried in a circle with their feet toward its
centre.&nbsp; When I asked, many years ago, the reason for this
arrangement, a wit of that day&mdash;a daughter, by the bye, of
Mrs. Stowe&mdash;replied, &ldquo;So that when they rise at the
Last Day only members of their own family may face
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One is struck by another peculiarity of these French men and
women&mdash;their astonishing proficiency in <i>les arts
d&rsquo;agr&eacute;ment</i>.&nbsp; Every Frenchwoman of any
pretensions to fashion backs her beauty and grace with some art
in which she is sure to be proficient.&nbsp; The dowager Duchesse
d&rsquo;Uz&eacute;s is a sculptor of mark, and when during the
autumn Mme. de Tr&eacute;dern gives opera at Brissac, she finds
little difficulty in recruiting her troupe from among the youths
and maidens under her roof whose musical education has been
thorough enough to enable them to sing difficult music in
public.</p>
<p>Love of the fine arts is felt in their conversation, in the
arrangement and decoration of their homes, and in the interest
that an exhibition of pictures or old furniture will
excite.&nbsp; Few of these people but are <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>
of the H&ocirc;tel Drouot and conversant with the value and
authenticity of the works of art daily sold there.&nbsp; Such
elements combine to form an atmosphere that does not exist in any
other country, and lends an interest to society in France which
it is far from possessing elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is but one way that an outsider can enter this Gallic
paradise.&nbsp; By marrying into it!&nbsp; Two of the seven
ladies in question lack the quarterings of the rest.&nbsp; Miss
Mitchell was only a charming American girl, and the mother of the
Princesse Radziwill was Mlle. Blanc of Monte Carlo.&nbsp;
However, as in most religions there are ceremonies that purify,
so in this case the sacrament of marriage is supposed to have
reconstructed these wives and made them genealogically whole.</p>
<p>There is something incongruous to most people in the idea of a
young girl hardly out of the schoolroom bearing a ponderous
title.&nbsp; The pomp and circumstance that surround historic
names connect them (through our reading) with stately matrons
playing the &ldquo;heavy female&rdquo; roles in life&rsquo;s
drama, much as Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s name evokes the idea of a
raw-boned mother-in-law sort of person, the reverse of
attractive, and quite the last woman in the world to egg her
husband on to a crime&mdash;unless it were wife murder!</p>
<p>Names like de Chevreuse, or de la Rochefoucauld, seem
appropriate only to the warlike amazons of the Fronde, or
corpulent kill-joys in powder and court trains of the Mme.
Etiquette school; it comes as a shock, on being presented to a
group of girlish figures in the latest cut of golfing skirts, who
are chattering odds on the Grand Prix in faultless English, to
realize that these light-hearted <i>gamines</i> are the present
owners of sonorous titles.&nbsp; One shudders to think what would
have been the effect on poor Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s priggish
mentor could she have foreseen her granddaughter, clad in
knickerbockers, running a petroleum tricycle in the streets of
Paris, or pedalling &ldquo;tandem&rdquo; across country behind
some young cavalry officer of her connection.</p>
<p>Let no simple-minded American imagine, however, that these
up-to-date women are waiting to welcome him and his family to
their intimacy.&nbsp; The world outside of France does not exist
for a properly brought up French aristocrat.&nbsp; Few have
travelled; from their point of view, any man with money, born
outside of France, is a &ldquo;Rasta,&rdquo; unless he come with
diplomatic rank, in which case his position at home is carefully
ferreted out before he is entertained.&nbsp; Wealthy foreigners
may live for years in Paris, without meeting a single member of
this coterie, who will, however, join any new club that promises
to be amusing; but as soon as the &ldquo;Rastas&rdquo; get a
footing, &ldquo;the seven&rdquo; and their following
withdraw.&nbsp; Puteaux had its day, then the &ldquo;Polo
Club&rdquo; in the Bois became their rendezvous.&nbsp; But as
every wealthy American and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; Englishwoman
passing the spring in Paris rushed for that too open circle, like
tacks toward a magnet, it was finally cut by the
&ldquo;Duchesses,&rdquo; who, together with such attractive
aides-de-camp as the Princesse de Poix, Mmes. de Murat, de Morny,
and de Broglie, inaugurated last spring &ldquo;The Ladies&rsquo;
Club of the Acacias,&rdquo; on a tiny island belonging to the
&ldquo;Tir aux Pigeons,&rdquo; which, for the moment, is the fad
of its founders.</p>
<p>It must be a surprise to those who do not know French family
pride to learn that exclusive as these women are there are
cliques in France to-day whose members consider the ladies we
have been speaking of as lacking in reserve.&nbsp; Men like Guy
de Durfort, Duc de Lorges, or the Duc de Massa, and their
womenkind, hold themselves aloof on an infinitely higher plane,
associating with very few and scorning the vulgar herd of
&ldquo;smart&rdquo; people!</p>
<p>It would seem as if such a vigorous weeding out of the
unworthy would result in a rather restricted comradeship.&nbsp;
Who the &ldquo;elect&rdquo; are must become each year more
difficult to discern.</p>
<p>Their point of view in this case cannot differ materially from
that of the old Methodist lady, who, while she was quite sure no
one outside of her own sect could possibly be saved, had grave
fears concerning the future of most of the congregation.&nbsp;
She felt hopeful only of the clergyman and herself, adding:
&ldquo;There are days when I have me doubts about the
minister!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 22&mdash;Growing Old Ungracefully</h2>
<p>There comes, we are told, a crucial moment, &ldquo;a
tide&rdquo; in all lives, that taken at the flood, leads on to
fortune.&nbsp; An assertion, by the bye, which is open to
doubt.&nbsp; What does come to every one is an hour fraught with
warning, which, if unheeded, leads on to folly.&nbsp; This
fateful date coincides for most of us with the discovery that we
are turning gray, or that the &ldquo;crow&rsquo;s feet&rdquo; or
our temples are becoming visible realities.&nbsp; The unpleasant
question then presents itself: Are we to slip meekly into middle
age, or are arms be taken up against our insidious enemy, and the
rest of life become a losing battle, fought inch by inch?</p>
<p>In other days it was the men who struggled the hardest against
their fate.&nbsp; Up to this century, the male had always been
the ornamental member of a family.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar, we read,
coveted a laurel crown principally because it would help to
conceal his baldness.&nbsp; The wigs of the Grand Monarque are
historical.&nbsp; It is characteristic of the time that the
latter&rsquo;s attempts at rejuvenation should have been taken as
a matter of course, while a few years later poor Madame de
Pompadour&rsquo;s artifices to retain her fleeting youth were
laughed at and decried.</p>
<p>To-day the situation is reversed.&nbsp; The battle, given up
by the men&mdash;who now accept their fate with
equanimity&mdash;is being waged by their better halves with a
vigor heretofore unknown.&nbsp; So general has this mania become
that if asked what one weakness was most characteristic of modern
women, what peculiarity marked them as different from their
sisters in other centuries, I should unhesitatingly answer,
&ldquo;The desire to look younger than their years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That people should long to be handsomer or taller or better
proportioned than a cruel Providence has made them, is natural
enough; but that so much time and trouble should be spent simply
in trying to look &ldquo;young,&rdquo; does seem unreasonable,
especially when it is evident to everybody that such efforts
must, in the nature of things, be failures.&nbsp; The men or
women who do not look their age are rare.&nbsp; In each
generation there are exceptions, people who, from one cause or
another&mdash;generally an excellent constitution&mdash;succeed
in producing the illusion of youth for a few years after youth
itself has flown.</p>
<p>A curious fatality that has the air of a nemesis pursues those
who succeed in giving this false appearance.&nbsp; When pointing
them out to strangers, their admirers (in order to make the
contrast more effective) add a decade or so to the real
age.&nbsp; Only last month I was sitting at dinner opposite a
famous French beauty, who at fifty succeeds in looking barely
thirty.&nbsp; During the meal both my neighbors directed
attention to her appearance, and in each case said:
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a wonder!&nbsp; You know she&rsquo;s over
sixty!&rdquo;&nbsp; So all that poor lady gained by looking
youthful was ten years added to her age!</p>
<p>The desire to remain attractive as long as possible is not
only a reasonable but a commendable ambition.&nbsp; Unfortunately
the stupid means most of our matrons adopt to accomplish this end
produce exactly the opposite result.</p>
<p>One sign of deficient taste in our day is this failure to
perceive that every age has a charm of its own which can be
enhanced by appropriate surroundings, but is lost when placed in
an incongruous setting.&nbsp; It saddens a lover of the beautiful
to see matrons going so far astray in their desire to please as
to pose for young women when they no longer can look the
part.</p>
<p>Holmes, in <i>My Maiden Aunt</i>, asks plaintively:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Why will she train that wintry curl in such a
springlike way</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this folly is in the air to-day, few will dispute.&nbsp;
It seems to be perpetrated unconsciously by the greater number,
with no particular object in view, simply because other people do
it.&nbsp; An unanswerable argument when used by one of the fair
sex!</p>
<p>Few matrons stop to think for themselves, or they would
realize that by appearing in the same attire as their daughters
they challenge a comparison which can only be to their
disadvantage, and should be if possible avoided.&nbsp; Is there
any disillusion more painful than, on approaching what appeared
from a distance to be a young girl, to find one&rsquo;s self face
to face with sixty years of wrinkles?&nbsp; That is a modern
version of the saying, &ldquo;an old head on young
shoulders,&rdquo; with a vengeance!&nbsp; If mistaken
sexagenarians could divine the effect that tired eyes smiling
from under false hair, aged throats clasped with collars of
pearls, and rheumatic old ribs braced into a semblance of girlish
grace, produce on the men for whose benefit such adornments have
been arranged, reform would quickly follow.&nbsp; There is
something absolutely uncanny in the illusion.&nbsp; The more
successful it is, the more weird the effect.</p>
<p>No one wants to see Polonius in the finery of Mercutio.&nbsp;
What a sense of fitness demands is, on the contrary, a
&ldquo;make up&rdquo; in keeping with the r&ocirc;le, which does
not mean that a woman is to become a frump, but only that she is
to make herself attractive in another way.</p>
<p>During the <i>Ancien R&eacute;gime</i> in France, matters of
taste were considered all-important; an entire court would
consult on the shade of a brocade, and hail a new coiffure as an
event.&nbsp; The great ladies who had left their youth behind
never then committed the blunder, so common among our middle-aged
ladies, of aping the maidens of the day.&nbsp; They were far too
clever for that, and appreciated the advantages to be gained from
sombre stuffs and flattering laces.&nbsp; Let those who doubt
study Nattier&rsquo;s exquisite portrait of Maria
Leczinska.&nbsp; Nothing in the pose or toilet suggests a desire
on the painter&rsquo;s part to rejuvenate his sitter.&nbsp; If
anything, the queen&rsquo;s age is emphasized as something
honorable.&nbsp; The gray hair is simply arranged and partly
veiled with black lace, which sets off her delicate, faded face
to perfection, but without flattery or fraud.</p>
<p>We find the same view taken of age by the masters of the
Renaissance, who appreciated its charm and loved to reproduce its
grace.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth stands out in history as a woman who struggled
ungracefully against growing old.&nbsp; Her wigs and hoops and
farthingales served only to make her ridiculous, and the fact
that she wished to be painted without shadows in order to appear
&ldquo;young,&rdquo; is recorded as an aberration of a great
mind.</p>
<p>Are there no painters to-day who will whisper to our wives and
mothers the secret of looking really lovely, and persuade them to
abandon their foolish efforts at rejuvenation?</p>
<p>Let us see some real old ladies once more, as they look at us
from miniature and portrait.&nbsp; Few of us, I imagine, but
cherish the memory of some such being in the old home, a
soft-voiced grandmother, with silvery hair brushed under a
discreet and flattering cap, with soft, dark raiment and
tulle-wrapped throat.&nbsp; There are still, it is to be hoped,
many such lovable women in our land, but at times I look about me
in dismay, and wonder who is to take their places when they are
gone.&nbsp; Are there to be no more &ldquo;old
ladies&rdquo;?&nbsp; Will the next generation have to look back
when the word &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo; is mentioned, to a
stylish vision in Parisian apparel, d&eacute;collet&eacute; and
decked in jewels, or arrayed in cocky little bonnets, perched on
tousled curls, knowing jackets, and golfing skirts?</p>
<p>The present horror of anything elderly comes, probably, from
the fact that the preceding generation went to the other extreme,
young women retiring at forty into becapped old age.&nbsp;
Knowing how easily our excitable race runs to exaggeration, one
trembles to think what surprises the future may hold, or what
will be the next decree of Dame Fashion.&nbsp; Having eliminated
the &ldquo;old lady&rdquo; from off the face of the earth, how
fast shall we continue down the fatal slope toward the
ridiculous?&nbsp; Shall we be compelled by a current stronger
than our wills to array ourselves each year (the bare thought
makes one shudder) in more and more youthful apparel, until
corpulent senators take to running about in &ldquo;sailor
suits,&rdquo; and octogenarian business men go &ldquo;down
town&rdquo; in &ldquo;pinafores,&rdquo; while belles of sixty or
seventy summers appear in Kate Greenaway costumes, and dine out
in short-sleeved bibs, which will allow coy glimpses of their
cunning old ankles to appear over their socks?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 23&mdash;Around a Spring</h2>
<p>The greatest piece of good luck that can befall a Continental
village is the discovery, within its limits, of a spring
supplying some kind of malodorous water.&nbsp; From that moment
the entire community, abandoning all other plans, give themselves
over to hatching their golden egg, experience having taught them
that no other source of prosperity can compare with a <i>source
thermale</i>.&nbsp; If the water of the newfound spring, besides
having an unpleasant smell, is also hot, then Providence has
indeed blessed the township.</p>
<p>The first step is to have the fluid analyzed by a celebrity,
and its medicinal qualities duly set forth in a
certificate.&nbsp; The second is to get official recognition from
the government and the authorization to erect a bath house.&nbsp;
Once these preliminaries accomplished, the way lies plain before
the fortunate village; every citizen, from the mayor down to the
humblest laborer, devotes himself to solving the all-important
problem how to attract strangers to the place and keep and amuse
them when they have been secured.</p>
<p>Multicolored pamphlets detailing the local attractions are
mailed to the four corners of the earth, and brilliant chromos of
the village, with groups of peasants in the foreground, wearing
picturesque costumes, are posted in every available railway
station and booking-office, regardless of the fact that no
costumes have been known in the neighborhood for half a century,
except those provided by the hotel proprietors for their
housemaids.&nbsp; A national dress, however, has a fine effect in
the advertisement, and gives a local color to the scene.&nbsp;
What, for instance, would Athens be without that superb
individual in national get-up whom one is sure to see before the
hotel on alighting from the omnibus?&nbsp; I am convinced that he
has given as much pleasure as the Acropolis to most travellers;
the knowledge that the hotel proprietors share the expenses of
his keep and toilet cannot dispel the charm of those scarlet
embroideries and glittering arms.</p>
<p>After preparing their trap, the wily inhabitants of a new
watering-place have only to sit down and await events.&nbsp; The
first people to appear on the scene are, naturally, the English,
some hidden natural law compelling that race to wander forever in
inexpensive by-ways and serve as pioneers for other
nations.&nbsp; No matter how new or inaccessible the spring, you
are sure to find a small colony of Britons installed in the
half-finished hotels, reading week-old editions of the
<i>Times</i>, and grumbling over the increase in prices since the
year before.</p>
<p>As soon as the first stray Britons have developed into an
&ldquo;English colony,&rdquo; the municipality consider
themselves authorized to construct a casino and open avenues,
which are soon bordered by young trees and younger villas.&nbsp;
In the wake of the English come invalids of other
nationalities.&nbsp; If a wandering &ldquo;crowned head&rdquo;
can be secured for a season, a great step is gained, as that will
attract the real paying public and the Americans, who as a
general thing are the last to appear on the scene.</p>
<p>At this stage of its evolution, the &ldquo;city fathers&rdquo;
build a theatre in connection with their casino, and (persuading
the government to wink at their evasion of the gambling laws) add
games of chance to the other temptations of the place.</p>
<p>There is no better example of the way a spring can be
developed by clever handling, and satisfactory results obtained
from advertising and judicious expenditure, than Aix-les-Bains,
which twenty years ago was but a tiny mountain village, and
to-day ranks among the wealthiest and most brilliant <i>eaux</i>
in Europe.&nbsp; In this case, it is true, they had tradition to
fall back on, for Aqu&aelig; Gratin&aelig; was already a favorite
watering-place in the year 30 B.C., when C&aelig;sar took the
cure.</p>
<p>There is little doubt in my mind that when the Roman Emperor
first arrived he found a colony of spinsters and retired army
officers (from recently conquered Britain) living around this
spring in <i>popin&aelig;</i> (which are supposed to have
corresponded to our modern boarding-house), wearing waterproof
togas and common-sense cothurni, with double cork soles.</p>
<p>The wife of another C&aelig;sar fled hither in 1814.&nbsp; The
little inn where she passed a summer in the company of her
one-eyed lover&mdash;while the fate of her husband and son was
being decided at Vienna and Waterloo&mdash;is still standing, and
serves as the annex of a vast new hotel.</p>
<p>The way in which a watering-place is &ldquo;run&rdquo; abroad,
where tourists are regarded as godsends, to be cherished,
spoiled, and despoiled, is amusingly different from the manner of
our village populations when summer visitors (whom they look upon
as natural enemies) appear on the scene.&nbsp; Abroad the entire
town, together with the surrounding villages, hamlets, and
farmhouses, rack their brains and devote their time to inventing
new amusements for the visitor, and original ways of enticing the
gold from his pocket&mdash;for, mind you, on both continents the
object is the same.&nbsp; In Europe the rural Machiavellis have
had time to learn that smiling faces and picturesque surroundings
are half the battle.</p>
<p>Another point which is perfectly understood abroad is that a
cure must be largely mental; that in consequence boredom retards
recovery.&nbsp; So during every hour of the day and evening a
different amusement is provided for those who feel inclined to be
amused.&nbsp; At Aix, for instance, Colonne&rsquo;s orchestra
plays under the trees at the Villa des Fleurs while you are
sipping your after-luncheon coffee.&nbsp; At three o&rsquo;clock
&ldquo;Guignol&rdquo; performs for the youngsters.&nbsp; At five
o&rsquo;clock there is another concert in the Casino.&nbsp; At
eight o&rsquo;clock an operetta is given at the villa, and a
comedy in the Casino, both ending discreetly at eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Once a week, as a variety, the park is
illuminated and fireworks help to pass the evening.</p>
<p>If neither music nor Guignol tempts you, every form of trap
from a four-horse break to a donkey-chair (the latter much in
fashion since the English queen&rsquo;s visit) is standing ready
in the little square.&nbsp; On the neighboring lake you have but
to choose between a dozen kinds of boats.&nbsp; The hire of all
these modes of conveyance being fixed by the municipality, and
plainly printed in boat or carriage, extortions or discussions
are impossible.&nbsp; If you prefer a ramble among the hills, the
wily native is lying in wait for you there also.&nbsp; When you
arrive breathless at your journey&rsquo;s end, a shady arbor
offers shelter where you may cool off and enjoy the view.&nbsp;
It is not by accident that a dish of freshly gathered
strawberries and a bowl of milk happen to be standing near
by.</p>
<p>When bicycling around the lake you begin to feel how nice a
half hour&rsquo;s rest would be.&nbsp; Presto! a terrace
overhanging the water appears, and a farmer&rsquo;s wife who
proposes brewing you a cup of tea, supplementing it with butter
and bread of her own making.&nbsp; Weak human nature cannot
withstand such blandishments.&nbsp; You find yourself becoming
fond of the people and their smiling ways, returning again and
again to shores where you are made so welcome.&nbsp; The fact
that &ldquo;business&rdquo; is at the bottom of all this in no
way interferes with one&rsquo;s enjoyment.&nbsp; On the contrary,
to a practical mind it is refreshing to see how much can be made
of a little, and what a fund of profit and pleasure can be
extracted from small things, if one goes to work in the right
way.</p>
<p>The trick can doubtless be overdone: at moments one feels the
little game is worked a bit too openly.&nbsp; The other evening,
for instance, when we entered the dining-room of our hotel and
found it decorated with flags and flowers, because, forsooth, it
was the birthday of &ldquo;Victoria R. and I.,&rdquo; when
champagne was offered at dessert and the band played &ldquo;God
Save the Queen,&rdquo; while the English solemnly stood up in
their places, it did seem as if the proprietor was poking fun at
his guests in a sly way.</p>
<p>I was apparently the only person, however, who felt
this.&nbsp; The English were much flattered by the attention, so
I snubbed myself with the reflection that if the date had been
July 4, I doubtless should have considered the flags and music
most <i>&agrave; propos</i>.</p>
<p>There are also moments when the vivid picturesqueness of this
place comes near to palling on one.&nbsp; Its beauty is so
suspiciously like a set scene that it gives the impression of
having been arranged by some clever decorator with an eye to
effect only.</p>
<p>One is continually reminded of that inimitable chapter in
Daudet&rsquo;s <i>Tartarin sur les Alpes</i>, when the hero
discovers that all Switzerland is one enormous humbug, run to
attract tourists; that the cataracts are &ldquo;faked,&rdquo; and
avalanches arranged beforehand to enliven a dull season.&nbsp;
Can anything be more delicious than the disillusion of Tartarin
and his friends, just back from a perilous chamois hunt, on
discovering that the animal they had exhausted themselves in
following all day across the mountains, was being refreshed with
hot wine in the kitchen of the hotel by its peasant owner?</p>
<p>When one visits the theatrical abbey across the lake and
inspects the too picturesque tombs of Savoy&rsquo;s sovereigns,
or walks in the wonderful old garden, with its intermittent
spring, the suspicion occurs, in spite of one&rsquo;s self, that
the whole scene will be folded up at sunset and the bare-footed
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; who is showing us around with so much
unction will, after our departure, hurry into another costume,
and appear later as one of the happy peasants who are singing and
drinking in front of that absurdly operatic little inn you pass
on the drive home.</p>
<p>There is a certain pink cottage, with a thatched roof and
overhanging vines, about which I have serious doubts, and fully
expect some day to see Columbine appear on that pistache-green
balcony (where the magpie is hanging in a wicker cage), and,
taking Arlequin&rsquo;s hand, disappear into the water-butt while
Clown does a header over the half-door, and the cottage itself
turns into a gilded coach, with Columbine kissing her hand from
the window.</p>
<p>A problem which our intelligent people have not yet set
themselves to solve, is being worked out abroad.&nbsp; The little
cities of Europe have discovered that prosperity comes with the
tourist, that with increased facilities of communication the
township which expends the most in money and brains in attracting
rich travellers to its gates is the place that will grow and
prosper.&nbsp; It is a simple lesson, and one that I would gladly
see our American watering-places learn and apply.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 24&mdash;The Better Part</h2>
<p>As I watch, year after year, the flowers of our aristocratic
hothouses blooming behind the glass partitions of their
conservatories, tended always by the same gardeners, admired by
the same amateurs, and then, for the most part, withering
unplucked on their virgin stems, I wonder if the wild flowers
appreciate the good luck that allows them to taste the storm and
the sunshine untrammelled and disperse perfume according to their
own sweet will.</p>
<p>To drop a cumbersome metaphor, there is not the shadow of a
doubt that the tamest and most monotonous lives in this country
are those led by the women in our &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; sets,
for the good reason that they are surrounded by all the trammels
of European society without enjoying any of its benefits, and
live in an atmosphere that takes the taste out of existence too
soon.</p>
<p>Girls abroad are kept away from the &ldquo;world&rdquo;
because their social life only commences after marriage.&nbsp; In
America, on the contrary, a woman is laid more or less on the
shelf the day she becomes a wife, so that if she has not made hay
while her maiden sunshine lasted, the chances are she will have
but meagrely furnished lofts; and how, I ask, is a girl to
harvest always in the same field?</p>
<p>When in this country, a properly brought up young aristocrat
is presented by her mamma to an admiring circle of friends, she
is quite a <i>blas&eacute;e</i> person.&nbsp; The dancing classes
she has attended for a couple of years before her d&eacute;but
(that she might know the right set of youths and maidens) have
taken the bloom off her entrance into the world.&nbsp; She and
her friends have already talked over the &ldquo;men&rdquo; of
their circle, and decided, with a sigh, that there were matches
going about.&nbsp; A juvenile Newporter was recently overheard
deploring (to a friend of fifteen summers), &ldquo;By the time we
come out there will only be two matches in the market,&rdquo;
meaning, of course, millionnaires who could provide their brides
with country and city homes, yachts, and the other appurtenances
of a brilliant position.&nbsp; Now, the unfortunate part of the
affair is, that such a worldly-minded maiden will in good time be
obliged to make her d&eacute;but, dine, and dance through a dozen
seasons without making a new acquaintance.&nbsp; Her migrations
from town to seashore, or from one country house to another, will
be but changes of scene: the actors will remain always the
same.&nbsp; When she dines out, she can, if she cares to take the
trouble, make a fair guess as to who the guests will be before
she starts, for each entertainment is but a new shuffle of the
too well-known pack.&nbsp; She is morally certain of being taken
in to dinner by one of fifty men whom she has known since her
childhood, and has met on an average twice a week since she was
eighteen.</p>
<p>Of foreigners such a girl sees little beyond a stray
diplomatist or two, in search of a fortune, and her glimpses of
Paris society are obtained from the windows of a hotel on the
Place Vend&ocirc;me.&nbsp; In London or Rome she may be presented
in a few international salons, but as she finds it difficult to
make her new acquaintances understand what an exalted position
she occupies at home, the chances are that pique at seeing some
Daisy Miller attract all the attention will drive my lady back to
the city where she is known and appreciated, nothing being more
difficult for an American &ldquo;swell&rdquo; than explaining to
the uninitiated in what way her position differs from that of the
rest of her compatriots.</p>
<p>When I see the bevies of highly educated and attractive girls
who make their bows each season, I ask myself in wonder,
&ldquo;Who, in the name of goodness, are they to
marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the very circle where so much stress is laid on a
girl&rsquo;s establishing herself brilliantly, the fewest
possible husbands are to be found.&nbsp; Yet, limited as such a
girl&rsquo;s choice is, she will sooner remain single than accept
a husband out of her set.&nbsp; She has a perfectly distinct idea
of what she wants, and has lived so long in the atmosphere of
wealth that existence without footmen and male cooks, horses and
French clothes, appears to her impossible.&nbsp; Such large
proportions do these details assume in her mind that each year
the husband himself becomes of less importance, and what he can
provide the essential point.</p>
<p>If an outsider is sufficiently rich, my lady may consent to
unite her destinies to his, hoping to get him absorbed into her
own world.</p>
<p>It is pathetic, considering the restricted number of eligible
men going about, to see the trouble and expense that parents take
to keep their daughters <i>en &eacute;vidence</i>.&nbsp; When one
reflects on the number of people who are disturbed when such a
girl dines out, the horses and men and women who are kept up to
convey her home, the time it has taken her to dress, the cost of
the toilet itself, and then see the man to whom she will be
consigned for the evening,&mdash;some bored man about town who
has probably taken her mother in to dinner twenty years before,
and will not trouble himself to talk with his neighbor, or a
schoolboy, breaking in his first dress suit,&mdash;when one
realizes that for many maidens this goes on night after night and
season after season, it seems incredible that they should have
the courage, or think it worth their while to keep up the
game.</p>
<p>The logical result of turning eternally in the same circle is
that nine times out of ten the men who marry choose girls out of
their own set, some pretty stranger who has burst on their jaded
vision with all the charm of the unknown.&nbsp; A conventional
society maiden who has not been fortunate enough to meet and
marry a man she loves, or whose fortune tempts her, during the
first season or two that she is &ldquo;out,&rdquo; will in all
probability go on revolving in an ever-narrowing circle until she
becomes stationary in its centre.</p>
<p>In comparison with such an existence the life of the average
&ldquo;summer girl&rdquo; is one long frolic, as varied as that
of her aristocratic sister is monotonous.&nbsp; Each spring she
has the excitement of selecting a new battle-ground for her
man&oelig;uvres, for in the circle in which she moves, parents
leave such details to their children.&nbsp; Once installed in the
hotel of her choice, mademoiselle proceeds to make the
acquaintance of an entirely new set of friends, delightful youths
just arrived, and bent on making the most of their brief
holidays, with whom her code of etiquette allows her to sail all
day, and pass uncounted evening hours in remote corners of piazza
or beach.</p>
<p>As the words &ldquo;position&rdquo; and &ldquo;set&rdquo; have
no meaning to her young ears, and no one has ever preached to her
the importance of improving her social standing, the
acquaintances that chance throws in her path are accepted without
question if they happen to be good-looking and amusing.&nbsp; She
has no prejudice as to standing, and if her supply of partners
runs short, she will dance and flirt with the clerk from the desk
in perfect good humor&mdash;in fact, she stands rather in awe of
that functionary, and admires the &ldquo;English&rdquo; cut of
his clothes and his Eastern swagger.&nbsp; A large hotel is her
dream of luxury, and a couple of simultaneous flirtations her
ideal of bliss.&nbsp; No long evenings of cruel boredom, in order
to be seen at smart houses, will cloud the maiden&rsquo;s career,
no agonized anticipation of retiring partnerless from cotillion
or supper will disturb her pleasure.</p>
<p>In the city she hails from, everybody she knows lives in about
the same style.&nbsp; Some are said to be wealthier than others,
but nothing in their way of life betrays the fact; the art of
knowing how to enjoy wealth being but little understood outside
of our one or two great cities.&nbsp; She has that tranquil sense
of being the social equal of the people she meets, the absence of
which makes the snob&rsquo;s life a burden.</p>
<p>During her summers away from home our &ldquo;young
friend&rdquo; will meet other girls of her age, and form
friendships that result in mutual visiting during the ensuing
winter, when she will continue to add more new names to the long
list of her admirers, until one fine morning she writes home to
her delighted parents that she has found the right man at last,
and engaged herself to him.</p>
<p>Never having penetrated to those sacred centres where birth
and wealth are considered all-important, and ignoring the supreme
importance of living in one set, the plan of life that such a
woman lays out for herself is exceedingly simple.&nbsp; She will
coquette and dance and dream her pleasant dream until Prince
Charming, who is to awaken her to a new life, comes and kisses
away the dew of girlhood and leads his bride out into the
work-a-day world.&nbsp; The simple surroundings and ambitions of
her youth will make it easy for this wife to follow the man of
her choice, if necessary, to the remote village where he is
directing a factory or to the mining camp where the foundations
of a fortune lie.&nbsp; Life is full of delicious possibilities
for her.&nbsp; Men who are forced to make their way in youth
often turn out to be those who make &ldquo;history&rdquo; later,
and a bride who has not become prematurely <i>blas&eacute;e</i>
to all the luxuries or pleasures of existence will know the
greatest happiness that can come into a woman&rsquo;s life, that
of rising at her husband&rsquo;s side, step by step, enjoying his
triumphs as she shared his poverty.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 25&mdash;La Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise &agrave;
Orange</h2>
<p>Idling up through the south of France, in company with a
passionate lover of that fair land, we learned on arriving at
Lyons, that the actors of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise
were to pass through there the next day, <i>en route</i> for
Orange, where a series of f&ecirc;tes had been arranged by
&ldquo;Les F&eacute;libres.&rdquo;&nbsp; This society, composed
of the writers and poets of Provence, have the preservation of
the Roman theatre at Orange (perhaps the most perfect specimen of
classical theatrical architecture in existence) profoundly at
heart, their hope being to restore some of its pristine beauty to
the ruin, and give from time to time performances of the Greek
masterpieces on its disused stage.</p>
<p>The money obtained by these representations will be spent in
the restoration of the theatre, and it is expected in time to
make Orange the centre of classic drama, as Beyreuth is that of
Wagnerian music.</p>
<p>At Lyons, the <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> was to leave the Paris
train and take boats down the Rh&ocirc;ne, to their
destination.&nbsp; Their programme was so tempting that the offer
of places in one of the craft was enough to lure us away from our
prearranged route.</p>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock the following morning, we were on foot,
as was apparently the entire city.&nbsp; A cannon fired from Fort
Lamothe gave the signal of our start.&nbsp; The river, covered
with a thousand gayly decorated craft, glinted and glittered in
the morning light.&nbsp; It world be difficult to forget that
scene,&mdash;the banks of the Rh&ocirc;ne were lined with the
rural population, who had come miles in every direction to
acclaim the passage of their poets.</p>
<p>Everywhere along our route the houses were gayly decorated and
arches of flowers had been erected.&nbsp; We float past Vienne, a
city once governed by Pontius Pilate, and Tournon, with its
feudal ch&acirc;teau, blue in the distance, then Saint Peray, on
a verdant vine-clad slope.&nbsp; As we pass under the bridge at
Mont&eacute;limar, an avalanche of flowers descends on us from
above.</p>
<p>The rapid current of the river soon brings our flotilla
opposite Vivier, whose Gothic cathedral bathes its feet in the
Rh&ocirc;ne.&nbsp; Saint Esprit and its antique bridge appear
next on the horizon.&nbsp; Tradition asserts that the Holy
Spirit, disguised as a stone mason, directed its construction;
there were thirteen workmen each day, but at sunset, when the men
gathered to be paid, but twelve could be counted.</p>
<p>Here the mayor and the municipal council were to have received
us and delivered an address, but were not on hand.&nbsp; We could
see the tardy <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> hastening towards the bridge
as we shot away down stream.</p>
<p>On nearing Orange, the banks and quays of the river are alive
with people.&nbsp; The high road, parallel with the stream, is
alive with a many-colored throng.&nbsp; On all sides one hears
the language of Mistral, and recognizes the music of Mireille
sung by these pilgrims to an artistic Mecca, where a miracle is
to be performed&mdash;and classic art called forth from its
winding-sheet.</p>
<p>The population of a whole region is astir under the ardent
Proven&ccedil;al sun, to witness a resurrection of the Drama in
the historic valley of the Rh&ocirc;ne, through whose channel the
civilization and art and culture of the old world floated up into
Europe to the ceaseless cry of the <i>cigales</i>.</p>
<p>Ch&acirc;teaurenard! our water journey is ended.&nbsp; Through
the leafy avenues that lead to Orange, we see the arch of Marius
and the gigantic proscenium of the theatre, rising above the
roofs of the little city.</p>
<p>So few of our compatriots linger in the south of France after
the spring has set in, or wander in the by-ways of that
inexhaustible country, that a word about the representations at
Orange may be of interest, and perchance create a desire to see
the masterpieces of classic drama (the common inheritance of all
civilized races) revived with us, and our stage put to its
legitimate use, cultivating and elevating the taste of the
people.</p>
<p>One would so gladly see a little of the money that is
generously given for music used to revive in America a love for
the classic drama.</p>
<p>We are certainly not inferior to our neighbors in culture or
appreciation, and yet such a performance as I witnessed at Orange
(laying aside the enchantment lent by the surroundings) would not
be possible here.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; But to return to my
narrative.</p>
<p>The sun is setting as we toil, ticket in hand, up the Roman
stairway to the upper rows of seats; far below the local
<i>gendarmerie</i> who mostly understand their orders backwards
are struggling with the throng, whose entrance they are
apparently obstructing by every means in their power.&nbsp; Once
seated, and having a wait of an hour before us, we amused
ourselves watching the crowd filling in every corner of the vast
building, like a rising tide of multi-colored water.</p>
<p>We had purposely chosen places on the highest and most remote
benches, to test the vaunted acoustic qualities of the
auditorium, and to obtain a view of the half-circle of humanity,
the gigantic wall back of the stage, and the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>As day softened into twilight, and twilight deepened into a
luminous Southern night; the effect was incomparable.&nbsp; The
belfries and roofs of medi&aelig;val Orange rose in the clear
air, overtopping the half ruined theatre in many places.&nbsp;
The arch of Marius gleamed white against the surrounding hills,
themselves violet and purple in the sunset, their shadow broken
here and there by the outline of a crumbling ch&acirc;teau or the
lights of a village.</p>
<p>Behind us the sentries paced along the wall, wrapped in their
dark cloaks; and over all the scene, one snowtopped peak rose
white on the horizon, like some classic virgin assisting at an
Olympian solemnity.</p>
<p>On the stage, partly cleared of the d&eacute;bris of fifteen
hundred years, trees had been left where they had grown, among
fallen columns, fragments of capital and statue; near the front a
superb rose-laurel recalled the Attic shores.&nbsp; To the right,
wild grasses and herbs alternated with thick shrubbery, among
which Orestes hid later, during the lamentations of his
sister.&nbsp; To the left a gigantic fig-tree, growing again the
dark wall, threw its branches far out over the stage.</p>
<p>It was from behind its foliage that &ldquo;Gaul,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Provence,&rdquo; and &ldquo;France,&rdquo; personated by
three actresses of the &ldquo;Fran&ccedil;ais,&rdquo; advanced to
salute Apollo, seated on his rustic throne, in the prologue which
began the performance.</p>
<p>Since midday the weather had been threatening.&nbsp; At seven
o&rsquo;clock there was almost a shower&mdash;a moment of
terrible anxiety.&nbsp; What a misfortune if it should rain, just
as the actors were to appear, here, where it had not rained for
nearly four months!&nbsp; My right-hand neighbor, a citizen of
Beaucaire, assures me, &ldquo;It will be nothing, only a strong
&lsquo;mistral&rsquo; for to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; An electrician
is putting the finishing touches to his arrangements.&nbsp; He
tries vainly to concentrate some light on the box where the
committee is to sit, which is screened by a bit of crumbling
wall, but finally gives it up.</p>
<p>Suddenly the bugles sound; the orchestra rings out the
Marseillaise; it is eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The sky is wild
and threatening.&nbsp; An unseen hand strikes the three
traditional blows.&nbsp; The Faun Lybrian slips down from a
branch of a great elm, and throws himself on the steps that later
are to represent the entrance to the palace of Agamemnon, and
commences the prologue (an invocation to Apollo), in the midst of
such confusion that we hear hardly a word.&nbsp; Little by
little, however, the crowd quiets down, and I catch Louis
Gallet&rsquo;s fine lines, marvellously phrased by Mesdames
Bartet, Dudlay, Moreno, and the handsome Fenoux as Apollo.</p>
<p>The real interest of the public is only aroused, however, when
<i>The Erynnies</i> begins.&nbsp; This powerful adaptation from
the tragedy of &AElig;schylus is <i>the chef
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of Leconte de Lisle.&nbsp; The silence is
now complete.&nbsp; One feels in the air that the moment so long
and so anxiously awaited has come, that a great event is about to
take place.&nbsp; Every eye is fixed on the stage, waiting to see
what will appear from behind the dark arches of the
proscenium.&nbsp; A faint, plaintive strain of music floats out
on the silence.&nbsp; Demons crawl among the leafy shadows.&nbsp;
Not a light is visible, yet the centre of the stage is in strong
relief, shading off into a thousand fantastic shadows.&nbsp; The
audience sits in complete darkness.&nbsp; Then we see the people
of Argos, winding toward us from among the trees, lamenting, as
they have done each day for ten years, the long absence of their
sons and their king.&nbsp; The old men no longer dare to consult
the oracles, fearing to learn that all is lost.&nbsp; The beauty
of this lament roused the first murmur of applause, each word,
each syllable, chiming out across that vast semicircle with a
clearness and an effect impossible to describe.</p>
<p>Now it is the sentinel, who from his watch-tower has caught
the first glimpse of the returning army.&nbsp; We hear him
dashing like a torrent down the turret stair; at the doorway, his
garments blown by the wind, his body bending forward in a
splendid pose of joy and exultation, he announces in a voice of
thunder the arrival of the king.</p>
<p>So completely are the twenty thousand spectators under the
spell of the drama that at this news one can feel a thrill pass
over the throng, whom the splendid verses hold palpitating under
their charm, awaiting only the end of the tirade to break into
applause.</p>
<p>From that moment the performance is one long triumph.&nbsp;
Clytemnestra (Madame Lerou) comes with her suite to receive the
king (Mounet-Sully), the conqueror!&nbsp; I never realized before
all the perfection that training can give the speaking
voice.&nbsp; Each syllable seemed to ring out with a bell-like
clearness.&nbsp; As she gradually rose in the last act to the
scene with Orestes, I understood the use of the great wall behind
the actors.&nbsp; It increased the power of the voices and lent
them a sonority difficult to believe.&nbsp; The effect was
overwhelming when, unable to escape death, Clytemnestra cries out
her horrible imprecations.</p>
<p>Mounet-Sully surpassed himself.&nbsp; Paul Mounet gave us the
complete illusion of a monster thirsting for blood, even his
mother&rsquo;s!&nbsp; When striking her as she struck his father,
he answers her despairing query, &ldquo;Thou wouldst not slay thy
mother?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Woman, thou hast ceased to be a
mother!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dudlay (as Cassandra) reaches a splendid
climax when she prophesies the misfortune hanging over her
family, which she is powerless to avert.</p>
<p>It is impossible in feeble prose to give any idea of the
impression those lines produce in the stupendous theatre, packed
to its utmost limits&mdash;the wild night, with a storm in the
air, a stage which seems like a clearing in some forest inhabited
by Titans, the terrible tragedy of &AElig;schylus following the
graceful f&ecirc;te of Apollo.</p>
<p>After the unavoidable confusion at the beginning, the vast
audience listen in profound silence to an expression of pure
art.&nbsp; They are no longer actors we hear, but
demi-gods.&nbsp; With voices of the storm, possessed by some
divine afflatus, thundering out verses of fire&mdash;carried out
of themselves in a whirlwind of passion, like antique prophets
and Sibyls foretelling the misfortunes of the world!</p>
<p>That night will remain immutably fixed in my memory, if I live
to be as old as the theatre itself.&nbsp; We were so moved, my
companion and I, and had seen the crowd so moved, that fearing to
efface the impression if we returned the second night to see
<i>Antigone</i>, we came quietly away, pondering over it all, and
realizing once again that a thing of beauty is a source of
eternal delight.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 26&mdash;Pre-palatial Newport</h2>
<p>The historic Ocean House of Newport is a ruin.&nbsp; Flames
have laid low the unsightly structure that was at one time the
best-known hotel in America.&nbsp; Its fifty-odd years of
existence, as well as its day, are over.&nbsp; Having served a
purpose, it has departed, together with the generation and habits
of life that produced it, into the limbo where old houses, old
customs, and superannuated ideas survive,&mdash;the memory of the
few who like to recall other days and wander from time to time in
a reconstructed past.</p>
<p>There was a certain appropriateness in the manner of its
taking off.&nbsp; The proud old structure had doubtless heard
projects of rebuilding discussed by its owners (who for some
years had been threatening to tear it down); wounded doubtless by
unflattering truths, the hotel decided that if its days were
numbered, an exit worthy of a leading r&ocirc;le was at least
possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pull me down, indeed!&nbsp; That is all
very well for ordinary hostleries, but from an establishment of
my pretensions, that has received the aristocracy of the country,
and countless foreign swells, something more is
expected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it turned the matter over and debated within its shaky old
brain (Mrs. Skewton fashion) what would be the most becoming and
effective way of retiring from the social whirl.&nbsp; Balls have
been overdone; people are no longer tempted by receptions; a
banquet was out of the question.&nbsp; Suddenly the wily building
hit on an idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them a <i>feu
d&rsquo;artifice</i>.&nbsp; There hasn&rsquo;t been a first-class
fire here since I burned myself down fifty-three years ago!&nbsp;
That kind of entertainment hasn&rsquo;t been run into the ground
like everything else in these degenerate days!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
do it in the best and most complete way, and give Newport
something to talk about, whenever my name shall be mentioned in
the future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daudet, in his <i>L&rsquo;Immortel</i>, shows us how some
people are born lucky.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Loisel of the
Institute,&rdquo; although an insignificant and commonplace man,
succeeded all through life in keeping himself before the public,
and getting talked about as a celebrity.&nbsp; He even arranged
(to the disgust and envy of his rivals) to die during a week when
no event of importance was occupying public attention.&nbsp; In
consequence, reporters, being short of &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; owing
to a dearth of murders and &ldquo;first nights,&rdquo; seized on
this demise and made his funeral an event.</p>
<p>The truth is, the Ocean House had lived so long in an
atmosphere of ostentatious worldliness that, like many residents
of the summer city, it had come to take itself and its
&ldquo;position&rdquo; seriously, and imagine that the eyes of
the country were fixed upon and expected something of it.</p>
<p>The air of Newport has always proved fatal to big
hotels.&nbsp; One after another they have appeared and failed,
the Ocean House alone dragging out a forlorn existence.&nbsp; As
the flames worked their will and the careless crowd enjoyed the
spectacle, one could not help feeling a vague regret for the old
place, more for what it represented than for any intrinsic value
of its own.&nbsp; Without greatly stretching a point it might be
taken to represent a social condition, a phase, as it were, in
our development.&nbsp; In a certain obscure way, it was an
epoch-marking structure.&nbsp; Its building closed the era of
primitive Newport, its decline corresponded with the end of the
pre-palatial period&mdash;an era extending from 1845 to 1885.</p>
<p>During forty years Newport had a unique existence, unknown to
the rest of America, and destined to have a lasting influence on
her ways, an existence now as completely forgotten as the earlier
boarding-house <i>matin&eacute;e dansante</i> time. <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a>&nbsp; The sixties, seventies, and
eighties in Newport were pleasant years that many of us regret in
spite of modern progress.&nbsp; Simple, inexpensive days, when
people dined at three (looking on the newly introduced six
o&rsquo;clock dinners as an English innovation and modern
&ldquo;frill&rdquo;), and &ldquo;high-teaed&rdquo; together
dyspeptically off &ldquo;sally lunns&rdquo; and
&ldquo;preserves,&rdquo; washed down by coffee and chocolate,
which it was the toilsome duty of a hostess to dispense from a
silver-laden tray; days when &ldquo;rockaways&rdquo; drawn by
lean, long-tailed horses and driven by mustached darkies were, if
not the rule, far from being an exception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dutch treat&rdquo; picnics, another archaic amusement,
flourished then, directed by a famous organizer at his farm, each
guest being told what share of the eatables it was his duty to
provide, an edict from which there was no appeal.</p>
<p>Sport was little known then, young men passing their
afternoons tooling solemnly up and down Bellevue Avenue in
top-hats and black frock-coats under the burning August sun.</p>
<p>This was the epoch when the Town and Country Club was young
and full of vigor.&nbsp; We met at each other&rsquo;s houses or
at historic sites to hear papers read on serious subjects.&nbsp;
One particular afternoon is vivid in my memory.&nbsp; We had all
driven out to a point on the shore beyond the Third Beach, where
the Norsemen were supposed to have landed during their apocryphal
visit to this continent.&nbsp; It had been a hot drive, but when
we stopped, a keen wind was blowing in from the sea.&nbsp; During
a pause in the prolix address that followed, a coachman&rsquo;s
voice was heard to mutter, &ldquo;If he jaws much longer all the
horses will be foundered,&rdquo; which brought the learned
address to an ignominious and hasty termination.</p>
<p>Newport during the pre-palatial era affected culture, and a
whiff of Boston pervaded the air, much of which was tiresome, yet
with an under-current of charm and refinement.&nbsp; Those who
had the privilege of knowing Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, will remember
the pleasant &ldquo;teas&rdquo; and sparkling conversation she
offered her guests in the unpretending cottage where the beauty
of the daughter was as brilliant as the mother&rsquo;s wit.</p>
<p>Two estates on Bellevue Avenue are now without the hostesses
who, in those days, showed the world what great ladies America
could produce.&nbsp; It was the foreign-born husband of one of
these women who gave Newport its first lessons in luxurious
living.&nbsp; Until then Americans had travelled abroad and seen
elaborately served meals and properly appointed stables without
the ambition of copying such things at home.&nbsp; Colonial and
revolutionary state had died out, and modern extravagance had not
yet appeared.&nbsp; In the interregnum much was neglected that
might have added to the convenience and grace of life.</p>
<p>In France, under Louis Philippe, and in England, during
Victoria&rsquo;s youth, taste reached an ebb tide; in neither of
those countries, however, did the general standard fall so low as
here.&nbsp; It was owing to the <i>savoir faire</i> of one man
that Newporters and New York first saw at home what they had
admired abroad,&mdash;liveried servants in sufficient numbers,
dinners served <i>&agrave; la Russe</i>, and breeched and booted
grooms on English-built traps, innovations quickly followed by
his neighbors, for the most marked characteristic of the American
is his ability to &ldquo;catch on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, during the war of the secession, our Naval Academy was
removed from Annapolis and installed in the empty Atlantic House
(corner of Bellevue Avenue and Pelham Street), hotel life had
already begun to decline; but the Ocean House, which was
considered a vast enterprise at that time, inherited from the
older hotels the custom of giving Saturday evening
&ldquo;hops,&rdquo; the cottagers arriving at these informal
entertainments toward nine o&rsquo;clock and promenading up and
down the corridors or dancing in the parlor, to the admiration of
a public collected to enjoy the spectacle.&nbsp; At eleven the
doors of the dining-room opened, and a line of well-drilled
darkies passed ices and lemonade.&nbsp; By half-past eleven (the
hour at which we now arrive at a dance) every one was at home and
abed.</p>
<p>One remembers with a shudder the military man&oelig;uvres that
attended hotel meals in those days, the marching and
countermarching, your dinner cooling while the head waiter
reviewed his men.&nbsp; That idiotic custom has been abandoned,
like many better and worse.&nbsp; Next to the American ability to
catch on comes the facility with which he can drop a fad.</p>
<p>In this peculiarity the history of Newport has been an epitome
of the country, every form of amusement being in turn taken up,
run into the ground, and then abandoned.&nbsp; At one time it was
the fashion to drive to Fort Adams of an afternoon and circle
round and round the little green to the sounds of a military
band; then, for no visible reason, people took to driving on the
Third Beach, an inaccessible and lonely point which for two or
three summers was considered the only correct promenade.</p>
<p>I blush to recall it, but at that time most of the turnouts
were hired hacks.&nbsp; Next, Graves Point, on the Ocean Drive,
became the popular meeting-place.&nbsp; Then society took to
attending polo of an afternoon, a sport just introduced from
India.&nbsp; This era corresponded with the opening of the Casino
(the old reading-room dating from 1854).&nbsp; For several years
every one crowded during hot August mornings onto the airless
lawns and piazzas of the new establishment.&nbsp; It seems on
looking back as if we must have been more fond of seeing each
other in those days than we are now.&nbsp; To ride up and down a
beach and bow filled our souls with joy, and the &ldquo;cake
walk&rdquo; was an essential part of every ball, the guests
parading in pairs round and round the room between the dances
instead of sitting quietly &ldquo;out.&rdquo;&nbsp; The opening
promenade at the New York Charity Ball is a survival of this
inane custom.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the Ocean House &ldquo;hops&rdquo; marked
the last stage in hotel life.&nbsp; Since then better-class
watering places all over the country have slowly but surely
followed Newport&rsquo;s lead.&nbsp; The closed caravansaries of
Bar Harbor and elsewhere bear silent testimony to the fact that
refined Americans are at last awakening to the charms of home
life during their holidays, and are discarding, as fast as
finances will permit, the pernicious herding system.&nbsp; In
consequence the hotel has ceased to be, what it undoubtedly was
twenty years ago, the focus of our summer life.</p>
<p>Only a few charred rafters remain of the Ocean House.&nbsp; A
few talkative old duffers like myself alone survive the day it
represents.&nbsp; Changing social conditions have gradually
placed both on the retired list.&nbsp; A new and palatial Newport
has replaced the simpler city.&nbsp; Let us not waste too much
time regretting the past, or be too sure that it was better than
the present.&nbsp; It is quite possible, if the old times we are
writing so fondly about should return, we might discover that the
same thing was true of them as a ragged urchin asserted the other
afternoon of the burning building:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Tom, did ye know there was the biggest room in the
world in that hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; what room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room for improvement, ya!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 27&mdash;<i>Sardou</i> at Marly-le-Roy</h2>
<p>Near the centre of that verdant triangle formed by Saint
Cloud, Versailles, and Saint Germain lies the village of
Marly-le-Roy, high up on a slope above the lazy Seine&mdash;an
entrancing corner of the earth, much affected formerly by French
crowned heads, and by the &ldquo;Sun King&rdquo; in particular,
who in his old age grew tired of Versailles and built here one of
his many villas (the rival in its day of the Trianons), and
proceeded to amuse himself therein with the same solemnity which
had already made vice at Versailles more boresome than virtue
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Two centuries and four revolutions have swept away all trace
of this kingly caprice and the art treasures it contained.&nbsp;
Alone, the marble horses of Coustou, transported later to the
Champs Elys&eacute;es, remain to attest the splendor of the
past.</p>
<p>The quaint village of Marly, clustered around its church,
stands, however&mdash;with the faculty that insignificant things
have of remaining unchanged&mdash;as it did when the most
polished court of Europe rode through it to and from the
hunt.&nbsp; On the outskirts of this village are now two forged
and gilded gateways through which the passer-by can catch a
glimpse of trim avenues, fountains, and well-kept lawns.</p>
<p>There seems a certain poetical justice in the fact that
Alexandre Dumas <i>fils</i> and Victorien Sardou, the two giants
of modern drama, should have divided between them the inheritance
of Louis XIV., its greatest patron.&nbsp; One of the gates is
closed and moss-grown.&nbsp; Its owner lies in
P&egrave;re-la-Chaise.&nbsp; At the other I ring, and am soon
walking up the famous avenue bordered by colossal sphinxes
presented to Sardou by the late Khedive.&nbsp; The big stone
brutes, connected in one&rsquo;s mind with heat and sandy wastes,
look oddly out of place here in this green wilderness&mdash;a
bite, as it were, out of the forest which, under different names,
lies like a mantle over the country-side.</p>
<p>Five minutes later I am being shown through a suite of antique
salons, in the last of which sits the great playwright.&nbsp; How
striking the likeness is to Voltaire,&mdash;the same delicate
face, lit by a half cordial, half mocking smile; the same fragile
body and indomitable spirit.&nbsp; The illusion is enhanced by
our surroundings, for the mellow splendor of the room where we
stand might have served as a background for the Sage of
Ferney.</p>
<p>Wherever one looks, works of eighteenth-century art meet the
eye.&nbsp; The walls are hung with Gobelin tapestries that fairly
take one&rsquo;s breath away, so exquisite is their design and
their preservation.&nbsp; They represent a marble colonnade, each
column of which is wreathed with flowers and connected to its
neighbor with garlands.</p>
<p>Between them are bits of delicate landscape, with here and
there a group of figures dancing or picnicking in the shadow of
tall trees or under fantastical porticos.&nbsp; The furniture of
the room is no less marvellous than its hangings.&nbsp; One turns
from a harpsichord of vernis-martin to the clock, a relic from
Louis XIV.&rsquo;s bedroom in Versailles; on to the
bric-&agrave;-brac of old Saxe or S&egrave;vres in admiring
wonder.&nbsp; My host drifts into his showman manner,
irresistibly comic in this writer.</p>
<p>The pleasures of the collector are apparently divided into
three phases, without counting the rapture of the hunt.&nbsp;
First, the delight a true amateur takes in living among rare and
beautiful things.&nbsp; Second, the satisfaction of showing
one&rsquo;s treasures to less fortunate mortals, and last, but
perhaps keenest of all, the pride which comes from the fact that
one has been clever enough to acquire objects which other people
want, at prices below their market value.&nbsp; Sardou evidently
enjoys these three sensations vividly.&nbsp; That he lives with
and loves his possessions is evident, and the smile with which he
calls your attention to one piece after another, and mentions
what they cost him, attests that the two other joys are not
unknown to him.&nbsp; He is old enough to remember the golden age
when really good things were to be picked up for modest sums,
before every parvenu considered it necessary to turn his house
into a museum, and factories existed for the production of
&ldquo;antiques&rdquo; to be sold to innocent amateurs.</p>
<p>In calling attention to a set of carved and gilded furniture,
covered in Beauvais tapestry, such as sold recently in Paris at
the Valen&ccedil;ay sale&mdash;Talleyrand collection&mdash;for
sixty thousand dollars, Sardou mentions with a laugh that he got
his fifteen pieces for fifteen hundred dollars, the year after
the war, from an old ch&acirc;teau back of Cannes!&nbsp; One
unique piece of tapestry had cost him less than one-tenth of that
sum.&nbsp; He discovered it in a peasant&rsquo;s stable under a
two-foot layer of straw and earth, where it had probably been
hidden a hundred years before by its owner, and then all record
of it lost by his descendants.</p>
<p>The mention of Cannes sets Sardou off on another train of
thought.&nbsp; His family for three generations have lived
there.&nbsp; Before that they were Sardinian fishermen.&nbsp; His
great-grandfather, he imagines, was driven by some tempest to the
shore near Cannes and settled where he found himself.&nbsp; Hence
the name!&nbsp; For in the patois of Proven&ccedil;al France an
inhabitant of Sardinia is still called <i>un Sardou</i>.</p>
<p>The sun is off the front of the house by this time, so we
migrate to a shady corner of the lawn for our
<i>ap&eacute;ritif</i>, the inevitable vermouth or
&ldquo;bitters&rdquo; which Frenchmen take at five
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Here another surprise awaits the visitor,
who has not realized, perhaps, to what high ground the crawling
local train has brought him.&nbsp; At our feet, far below the
lawn and shade trees that encircle the ch&acirc;teau, lies the
Seine, twisting away toward Saint Germain, whose terrace and
dismantled palace stand outlined against the sky.&nbsp; To our
right is the plain of Saint Denis, the cathedral in its midst
looking like an opera-glass on a green table.&nbsp; Further still
to the right, as one turns the corner of the terrace, lies Paris,
a white line on the horizon, broken by the mass of the Arc de
Triomphe, the roof of the Op&eacute;ra, and the Eiffel Tower,
resplendent in a fresh coat of yellow lacquer!</p>
<p>The ground where we stand was occupied by the feudal castle of
Les Sires de Marly; although all traces of that stronghold
disappeared centuries ago, the present owner of the land points
out with pride that the extraordinary beauty of the trees around
his house is owing to the fact that their roots reach deep down
to the rich loam collected during centuries in the castle&rsquo;s
moat.</p>
<p>The little ch&acirc;teau itself, built during the reign of
Louis XIV. for the <i>grand-veneur</i> of the forest of Marly, is
intensely French in type,&mdash;a long, low building on a stone
terrace, with no trace of ornament about its white fa&ccedil;ade
or on its slanting roof.&nbsp; Inside, all the rooms are
&ldquo;front,&rdquo; communicating with each other <i>en
suite</i>, and open into a corridor running the length of the
building at the back, which, in turn, opens on a stone
court.&nbsp; Two lateral wings at right angles to the main
building form the sides of this courtyard, and contain <i>les
communs</i>, the kitchen, laundry, servants&rsquo; rooms, and the
other annexes of a large establishment.&nbsp; This arrangement
for a summer house is for some reason neglected by our American
architects.&nbsp; I can recall only one home in America built on
this plan.&nbsp; It is Giraud Foster&rsquo;s beautiful villa at
Lenox.&nbsp; You may visit five hundred French ch&acirc;teaux and
not find one that differs materially from this plan.&nbsp; The
American idea seems on the contrary to be a square house with a
room in each corner, and all the servants&rsquo; quarters stowed
away in a basement.&nbsp; Cottage and palace go on reproducing
that foolish and inconvenient arrangement indefinitely.</p>
<p>After an hour&rsquo;s chat over our drinks, during host has
rippled on from one subject to another with the lightness of
touch of a born talker, we get on to the subject of the grounds,
and his plans for their improvement.</p>
<p>Good luck has placed in Sardou&rsquo;s hands an old map of the
gardens as they existed in the time of Louis XV., and several
prints of the ch&acirc;teau dating from about the same epoch have
found their way into his portfolios.&nbsp; The grounds are, under
his care, slowly resuming the appearance of former days.&nbsp;
Old avenues reopen, statues reappear on the disused pedestals,
fountains play again, and clipped hedges once more line out the
terraced walks.</p>
<p>In order to explain how complete this work will be in time,
Sardou hurries me off to inspect another part of his
collection.&nbsp; Down past the stables, in an unused corner of
the grounds, long sheds have been erected, under which is stored
the d&eacute;bris of a dozen palaces, an assortment of
eighteenth-century art that could not be duplicated even in
France.</p>
<p>One shed shelters an entire semicircle of <i>treillage</i>,
pure Louis XV., an exquisite example of a lost art.&nbsp;
Columns, domes, panels, are packed away in straw awaiting
resurrection in some corner hereafter to be chosen.&nbsp; A dozen
seats in rose-colored marble from Fontainebleau are huddled
together near by in company with a row of gigantic marble masques
brought originally from Italy to decorate Fouquet&rsquo;s
fountains at his ch&acirc;teau of Vaux in the short day of its
glory.&nbsp; Just how this latter find is to be utilized their
owner has not yet decided.&nbsp; The problem, however, to judge
from his manner, is as important to the great playwright as the
plot of his next drama.</p>
<p>That the blood of an antiquarian runs in Sardou&rsquo;s veins
is evident in the subdued excitement with which he shows you his
possessions&mdash;statues from Versailles, forged gates and
balconies from Saint Cloud, the carved and gilded wood-work for a
dozen rooms culled from the four corners of France.&nbsp; Like
the true dramatist, he has, however, kept his finest effect for
the last.&nbsp; In the centre of a circular rose garden near by
stands, alone in its beauty, a column from the fa&ccedil;ade of
the Tuileries, as perfect from base to flower-crowned capital as
when Philibert Delorme&rsquo;s workmen laid down their tools.</p>
<p>Years ago Sardou befriended a young stone mason, who through
this timely aid prospered, and, becoming later a rich builder,
received in 1882 from the city of Paris the contract to tear down
the burned ruins of the Tuileries.&nbsp; While inspecting the
palace before beginning the work of demolition, he discovered one
column that had by a curious chance escaped both the flames of
the Commune and the patriotic ardor of 1793, which effaced all
royal emblems from church and palace alike.&nbsp; Remembering his
benefactor&rsquo;s love for antiquities with historical
associations, the grateful contractor appeared one day at Marly
with this column on a dray, and insisted on erecting it where it
now stands, pointing out to Sardou with pride the crowned
&ldquo;H,&rdquo; of Henri Quatre, and the entwined &ldquo;M.
M.&rdquo; of Marie de M&eacute;dicis, topped by the Florentine
lily in the flutings of the shaft and on the capital.</p>
<p>A question of mine on Sardou&rsquo;s manner of working led to
our abandoning the gardens and mounting to the top floor of the
ch&acirc;teau, where his enormous library and collection of
prints are stored in a series of little rooms or alcoves, lighted
from the top and opening on a corridor which runs the length of
the building.&nbsp; In each room stands a writing-table and a
chair; around the walls from floor to ceiling and in huge
portfolios are arranged his books and engravings according to
their subject.&nbsp; The Empire alcove, for instance, contains
nothing but publications and pictures relating to that
epoch.&nbsp; Roman and Greek history have their alcoves, as have
medi&aelig;val history and the reigns of the different
Louis.&nbsp; Nothing could well be conceived more conducive to
study than this arrangement, and it makes one realize how honest
was the master&rsquo;s reply when asked what was his favorite
amusement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Work!&rdquo; answered the author.</p>
<p>Our conversation, as was fated, soon turned to the enormous
success of <i>Robespierre</i> in London&mdash;a triumph that even
Sardou&rsquo;s many brilliant victories had not yet equalled.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the French disposition that neither
the author nor any member of his family could summon courage to
undertake the prodigious journey from Paris to London in order to
see the first performance.&nbsp; Even Sardou&rsquo;s business
agent, M. Roget, did not get further than Calais, where his
courage gave out.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sea was so
terrible!&rdquo;&nbsp; Both those gentlemen, however, took it
quite as a matter of course that Sardou&rsquo;s American agent
should make a three-thousand-mile journey to be present at the
first night.</p>
<p>The fact that the French author resisted Sir Henry
Irving&rsquo;s pressing invitations to visit him in no way
indicates a lack of interest in the success of the play.&nbsp; I
had just arrived from London, and so had to go into every detail
of the performance, a rather delicate task, as I had been
discouraged with the acting of both Miss Terry and Irving, who
have neither of them the age, voice, nor temperament to represent
either the revolutionary tyrant or the woman he betrayed.&nbsp;
As the staging had been excellent, I enlarged on that side of the
subject, but when pressed into a corner by the author, had to
acknowledge that in the scene where Robespierre, alone at
midnight in the Conciergerie, sees the phantoms of his victims
advance from the surrounding shadows and form a menacing circle
around him, Irving had used his poor voice with so little skill
that there was little left for the splendid climax, when, in
trying to escape from his ghastly visitors, Robespierre finds
himself face to face with Marie Antoinette, and with a wild cry,
half of horror, half of remorse, falls back insensible.</p>
<p>In spite of previous good resolutions, I must have given the
author the impression that Sir Henry spoke too loud at the
beginning of this scene and was in consequence inadequate at the
end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Sardou.&nbsp; &ldquo;He raised his
voice in that act!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s a scene to be played
with the soft pedal down!&nbsp; This is the way it should be
done!&rdquo;&nbsp; Dropping into a chair in the middle of the
room my host began miming the gestures and expression of
Robespierre as the phantoms (which, after all, are but the
figments of an over-wrought brain) gather around him.&nbsp;
Gradually he slipped to the floor, hiding his face with his
upraised elbow, whispering and sobbing, but never raising his
voice until, staggering toward the portal to escape, he meets the
Queen face to face.&nbsp; Then the whole force of his voice came
out in one awful cry that fairly froze the blood in my veins!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a teacher you would make!&rdquo; instinctively
rose to my lips as he ended.</p>
<p>With a careless laugh, Sardou resumed his shabby velvet cap,
which had fallen to the floor, and answered: &ldquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s nothing!&nbsp; I only wanted to prove to you that the
scene was not a fatiguing one for the voice if played
properly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no actor and could not teach, but any
one ought to know enough not to shout in that scene!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This with some bitterness, as news had arrived that
Irving&rsquo;s voice had given out the night before, and he had
been replaced by his half-baked son in the title r&ocirc;le, a
change hardly calculated to increase either the box-office
receipts or the success of the new drama.</p>
<p>Certain ominous shadows which, like Robespierre&rsquo;s
visions, had been for some time gathering in the corners of the
room warned me that the hour had come for my trip back to
Paris.&nbsp; Declining reluctantly an invitation to take potluck
with my host, I was soon in the Avenue of the Sphinx again.&nbsp;
As we strolled along, talking of the past and its charm, a couple
of men passed us, carrying a piece of furniture rolled in
burlaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another acquisition?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
epoch has tempted you this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you won&rsquo;t stop and inspect
it,&rdquo; answered Sardou with a twinkle in his eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I bought yesterday for my
bedroom.&nbsp; An armchair!&nbsp; Pure Loubet!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 28&mdash;Inconsistencies</h2>
<p>The dinner had been unusually long and the summer evening
warm.&nbsp; During the wait before the dancing began I must have
dropped asleep in the dark corner of the piazza where I had
installed myself, to smoke my cigar, away from the other men and
their tiresome chatter of golf and racing.&nbsp; Through the open
window groups of women could be seen in the ball-room, and the
murmur of their conversation floated out, mingling with the
laughter of the men.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in that casual way peculiar to dreams, I found
myself conversing with a solemn young Turk, standing in all the
splendor of fez and stambouline beside my chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Effendi,&rdquo; he was murmuring.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is this an American ball?&nbsp; I was asked at nine
o&rsquo;clock; it is now past eleven.&nbsp; Is there not some
mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;When a hostess
puts nine o&rsquo;clock on her card of invitation she expects her
guests at eleven or half-past, and would be much embarrassed to
be taken literally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we were speaking, our host rose.&nbsp; The men, reluctantly
throwing away their cigars, began to enter the ball-room through
the open windows.&nbsp; On their approach the groups of women
broke up, the men joining the girls where they sat, or inviting
them out to the lantern-lit piazza, where the couples retired to
dim, palm-embowered corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure I have not made a mistake?&rdquo; asked my
interlocutor, with a faint quiver of the eyelids.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is my intention, while travelling, to remain faithful to my
harem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hastened to reassure him and explain that he was in an
exclusive and reserved society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he murmured incredulously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When I was passing through New York last winter a lady was
pointed out to me as the owner of marvellous jewels and vast
wealth, but with absolutely no social position.&nbsp; My
informant added that no well-born woman would receive her or her
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s foolish, of course, but the handsome woman
with the crown on sitting in the centre of that circle, looks
very like the woman I mean.&nbsp; Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same lady,&rdquo; I answered,
wearily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are speaking of last year.&nbsp; No one
could be induced to call on the couple then.&nbsp; Now we all go
to their house, and entertain them in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have doubtless done some noble action, or the
reports about the husband have been proved false?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind has taken place.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
a success, and no one asks any questions!&nbsp; In spite of that,
you are in a society where the standard of conduct is held higher
than in any country of Europe, by a race of women more virtuous,
in all probability, than has yet been seen.&nbsp; There is not a
man present,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;who would presume to take, or
a woman who would permit, a liberty so slight even as the resting
of a youth&rsquo;s arm across the back of her chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I was speaking, an invisible orchestra began to sigh out
the first passionate bars of a waltz.&nbsp; A dozen couples rose,
the men clasping in their arms the slender matrons, whose smiling
faces sank to their partners&rsquo; shoulders.&nbsp; A blond
mustache brushed the forehead of a girl as she swept by us to the
rhythm of the music, and other cheeks seemed about to touch as
couples glided on in unison.</p>
<p>The sleepy Oriental eyes of my new acquaintance opened wide
with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, you must understand,&rdquo; I continued, hastily,
&ldquo;is quite another matter.&nbsp; Those people are
waltzing.&nbsp; It is considered perfectly proper, when the
musicians over there play certain measures, for men to take
apparent liberties.&nbsp; Our women are infinitely
self-respecting, and a man who put his arm around a woman (in
public) while a different measure was being played, or when there
was no music, would be ostracized from polite society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to understand,&rdquo; replied the
Turk.&nbsp; &ldquo;The husbands and brothers of these women guard
them very carefully.&nbsp; Those men I see out there in the dark
are doubtless with their wives and sisters, protecting them from
the advances of other men.&nbsp; Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re not right,&rdquo; I snapped out,
beginning to lose my temper at his obtuseness.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
husband would dream of talking to his wife in public, or of
sitting with her in a corner.&nbsp; Every one would be laughing
at them.&nbsp; Nor could a sister be induced to remain away from
the ball-room with her brother.&nbsp; Those girls are
&lsquo;sitting out&rsquo; with young men they like, indulging in
a little innocent flirtation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Flirtation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An American custom rather difficult to explain.&nbsp;
It may, however, be roughly defined as the art of leading a man a
long way on the road to&mdash;nowhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women flirt with friends or acquaintances, never with
members of their family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The husbands are those dejected individuals wandering
aimlessly about over there like lost souls.&nbsp; They are mostly
rich men, who, having married beautiful girls for love, wear
themselves out maintaining elaborate and costly establishments
for them.&nbsp; In return for his labor a husband, however,
enjoys but little of his wife&rsquo;s society, for a really
fashionable woman can rarely be induced to go home until she has
collapsed with fatigue.&nbsp; In consequence, she contributes
little but &lsquo;nerves&rsquo; and temper to the
household.&nbsp; Her sweetest smiles, like her freshest toilets,
are kept for the public.&nbsp; The husband is the last person
considered in an American household.&nbsp; If you doubt what I
say, look behind you.&nbsp; There is a newly married man speaking
with his wife, and trying to persuade her to leave before the
cotillion begins.&nbsp; Notice his apologetic air!&nbsp; He knows
he is interrupting a tender conversation and taking an
unwarrantable liberty.&nbsp; Nothing short of extreme fatigue
would drive him to such an extremity.&nbsp; The poor millionnaire
has hardly left his desk in Wall Street during the week, and only
arrived this evening in time to dress for dinner.&nbsp; He would
give a fair slice of his income for a night&rsquo;s rest.&nbsp;
See!&nbsp; He has failed, and is lighting another cigar,
preparing, with a sigh, for a long wait.&nbsp; It will be three
before my lady is ready to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a silence of some minutes, during which he appeared to
be turning these remarks over in his mind, the young Oriental
resumed: &ldquo;The single men who absorb so much of your
women&rsquo;s time and attention are doubtless the most
distinguished of the nation,&mdash;writers, poets, and
statesmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was obliged to confess that this was not the case; that, on
the contrary, the dancing bachelors were for the most part
impecunious youths of absolutely no importance, asked by the
hostess to fill in, and so lightly considered that a woman did
not always recognize in the street her guests of the evening
before.</p>
<p>At this moment my neighbor&rsquo;s expression changed from
bewilderment to admiration, as a young and very lovely matron
threw herself, panting, into a low chair at his side.&nbsp; Her
d&eacute;collet&eacute; was so daring that the doubts of half an
hour before were evidently rising afresh in his mind.&nbsp;
Hastily resuming my task of mentor, I explained that a
d&eacute;collet&eacute; corsage was an absolute rule for evening
gatherings.&nbsp; A woman who appeared in a high bodice or with
her neck veiled would be considered lacking in politeness to her
hostess as much if she wore a bonnet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With us, women go into the world to shine and
charm.&nbsp; It is only natural they should use all the weapons
nature has given them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished
Ottoman.&nbsp; &ldquo;But where will all this end?&nbsp; You
began by allowing your women to appear in public with their faces
unveiled, then you suppressed the fichu and the collarette, and
now you rob them of half their corsage.&nbsp; Where, O Allah,
will you stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I answered, laughing, &ldquo;the tendency of
civilization is to simplify; many things may yet
disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly.&nbsp; You have no prejudice
against women wearing in public toilets that we consider fitted
only for strict intimacy.&nbsp; In that case your ladies may walk
about the streets in these costumes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would
provoke a scandal if a woman were to be seen during the daytime
in such attire, either at home or abroad.&nbsp; The police and
the law courts would interfere.&nbsp; Evening dress is intended
only for reunions in private houses, or at most, to be worn at
entertainments where the company is carefully selected and the
men asked from lists prepared by the ladies themselves.&nbsp; No
lady would wear a ball costume or her jewels in a building where
the general public was admitted.&nbsp; In London great ladies
dine at restaurants in full evening dress, but we Americans, like
the French, consider that vulgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, last winter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when passing
through New York, I went to a great theatre, where there were an
orchestra and many singing people.&nbsp; Were not those
respectable women I saw in the boxes?&nbsp; There were no
<i>moucharabies</i> to screen them from the eyes of the
public.&nbsp; Were all the men in that building asked by special
invitation?&nbsp; That could hardly be possible, for I paid an
entrance fee at the door.&nbsp; From where I sat I could see
that, as each lady entered her box, opera-glasses were fixed on
her, and her &lsquo;points,&rsquo; as you say, discussed by the
crowd of men in the corridors, who, apparently, belonged to quite
the middle class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor, innocent Padischa, you do not understand at
all.&nbsp; That was the opera, which makes all the
difference.&nbsp; The husbands of those women pay enormous
prices, expressly that their wives may exhibit themselves in
public, decked in jewels and suggestive toilets.&nbsp; You could
buy a whole harem of fair Circassians for what one of those
little square boxes costs.&nbsp; A lady whose entrance caused no
sensation would feel bitterly disappointed.&nbsp; As a rule, she
knows little about music, and cares still less, unless some
singer is performing who is paid a fabulous price, which gives
his notes a peculiar charm.&nbsp; With us most things are valued
by the money they have cost.&nbsp; Ladies attend the opera simply
and solely to see their friends and be admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It grieves me to see that you are forming a poor
opinion of our woman kind, for they are more charming and modest
than any foreign women.&nbsp; A girl or matron who exhibits more
of her shoulders than you, with your Eastern ideas, think quite
proper, would sooner expire than show an inch above her
ankle.&nbsp; We have our way of being modest as well as you, and
that is one of our strongest prejudices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know you are joking,&rdquo; he replied, with a
slight show of temper, &ldquo;or trying to mystify me, for only
this morning I was on the beach watching the bathing, and I saw a
number of ladies in quite short skirts&mdash;up to their knees,
in fact&mdash;with the thinnest covering on their shapely
extremities.&nbsp; Were those women above suspicion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; I assured him, feeling inclined to
tear my hair at such stupidity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see
the difference?&nbsp; That was in daylight.&nbsp; Our customs
allow a woman to show her feet, and even a little more, in the
morning.&nbsp; It would be considered the acme of indecency to
let those beauties be seen at a ball.&nbsp; The law allows a
woman to uncover her neck and shoulders at a ball, but she would
be arrested if she appeared d&eacute;collet&eacute; on the beach
of a morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long silence followed, broken only by the music and laughter
from the ball-room.&nbsp; I could see my dazed Mohammedan remove
his fez and pass an agitated hand through his dark hair; then he
turned, and saluting me gravely, murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you to have taken so much trouble
with me.&nbsp; I do not doubt that what you have said is full of
the wisdom and consistency of a new civilization, which I fail to
appreciate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, with a sigh, he added: &ldquo;It
will be better for me to return to my own country, where there
are fewer exceptions to rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a profound salaam the gentle youth disappeared into the
surrounding darkness, leaving me rubbing my eyes and asking
myself if, after all, the dreamland Oriental was not about
right.&nbsp; Custom makes many inconsistencies appear so logical
that they no longer cause us either surprise or emotion.&nbsp;
But can we explain them?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 29&mdash;Modern &ldquo;Cadets de Gascogne&rdquo;</h2>
<p>After witnessing the performance given by the Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise in the antique theatre at Orange, we
determined&mdash;my companion and I&mdash;if ever another
opportunity of the kind offered, to attend, be the material
difficulties what they might.</p>
<p>The theatrical &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in their courses proved
favorable to the accomplishment of this vow.&nbsp; Before the
year ended it was whispered to us that the &ldquo;Cadets de
Gascogne&rdquo; were planning a tram through the Cevennes
Mountains and their native Languedoc&mdash;a sort of lay
pilgrimage to famous historic and literary shrines, a voyage to
be enlivened by much crowning of busts and reciting of verses in
the open air, and incidentally, by the eating of Gascony dishes
and the degustation of delicate local wines; the whole to
culminate with a representation in the arena at B&eacute;ziers of
<i>D&eacute;janire</i>, Louis Gallet&rsquo;s and
Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo;s latest work, under the personal
supervision of those two masters.</p>
<p>A tempting programme, was it not, in these days of cockney
tours and &ldquo;Cook&rdquo; couriers?&nbsp; At any rate, one
that we, with plenty of time on our hands and a weakness for
out-of-the-way corners and untrodden paths, found it impossible
to resist.</p>
<p>Rostand, in <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, has shown us the
&ldquo;Cadets&rdquo; of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s time, a fighting,
rhyming, devil-may-care band, who wore their hearts on their
sleeves and chips on their stalwart shoulders; much such a
brotherhood, in short, as we love to imagine that Shakespeare,
Kit Marlowe, Greene, and their intimates formed when they met at
the &ldquo;Ship&rdquo; to celebrate a success or drink a health
to the drama.</p>
<p>The men who compose the present society (which has now for
many years borne a name only recently made famous by M.
Rostand&rsquo;s genius) come delightfully near realizing the
happy conditions of other days, and&mdash;less the
fighting&mdash;form as joyous and picturesque a company as their
historic elders.&nbsp; They are for the most part Southern-born
youths, whose interests and ambitions centre around the stage,
devotees at the altar of Melpomene, ardent lovers of letters and
kindred arts, and proud of the debt that literary France owes to
Gascony.</p>
<p>It is the pleasant custom of this coterie to meet on winter
evenings in unfrequented <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, transformed by them
for the time into clubs, where they recite new-made verses,
discuss books and plays, enunciate paradoxes that make the very
waiters shudder, and, between their &ldquo;bocks,&rdquo; plan
vast revolutions in the world of literature.</p>
<p>As the pursuit of &ldquo;letters&rdquo; is, if anything, less
lucrative in France than in other countries, the question of next
day&rsquo;s dinner is also much discussed among these budding
Moli&egrave;res, who are often forced to learn early in their
careers, when meals have been meagre, to satisfy themselves with
rich rhymes and drink their fill of flowing verse.</p>
<p>From time to time older and more successful members of the
corporation stray back into the circle, laying aside their laurel
crowns and Olympian pose, in the society of the new-comers to
Bohemia.&nbsp; These honorary members enjoy nothing more when
occasion offers than to escape from the toils of greatness and
join the &ldquo;Cadets&rdquo; in their summer journeys to and fro
in France, trips which are made to combine the pleasures of an
outing with the aims of a literary campaign.&nbsp; It was an
invitation to join one of these tramps that tempted my friend and
me away from Paris at the season when that city is at its
best.&nbsp; Being unable, on account of other engagements, to
start with the cohort from the capital, we made a dash for it and
caught them up at Carcassonne during the f&ecirc;tes that the
little Languedoc city was offering to its guests.</p>
<p>After having seen Aigues Mortes, it was difficult to believe
that any other place in Europe could suggest more vividly the
days of military feudalism.&nbsp; St. Louis&rsquo;s tiny city is,
however, surpassed by Carcassonne!</p>
<p>Thanks to twenty years of studious restoration by Viollet le
Duc, this antique jewel shines in its setting of slope and plain
as perfect to-day (seen from the distance) as when the Crusaders
started from its crenelated gates for the conquest of the Holy
Sepulchre.&nbsp; The acropolis of Carcassonne is crowned with
Gothic battlements, the golden polygon of whose walls, rising
from Roman foundations and layers of ruddy Visigoth brick to the
stately marvel of its fifty towers, forms a whole that few can
view unmoved.</p>
<p>We found the Cadets lunching on the platform of the great
western keep, while a historic pageant organized in their honor
was winding through the steep medi&aelig;val streets&mdash;a
cavalcade of archers, men at arms, and many-colored troubadours,
who, after effecting a triumphal entrance to the town over
lowered drawbridges, mounted to unfurl their banner on our
tower.&nbsp; As the gaudy standard unfolded on the evening air,
Mounet-Sully&rsquo;s incomparable voice breathed the very soul of
the &ldquo;Burgraves&rdquo; across the silent plain and down
through the echoing corridors below.&nbsp; While we were still
under the impression of the stirring lines, he changed his key
and whispered:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Le soir tombe</i>. . . . <i>L&rsquo;heure
douce</i><br />
<i>Qui s&rsquo;&egrave;loigne sans secousse</i>,<br />
<i>Pose &agrave; peine sur la mousse</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ses pieds</i>.<br />
<i>Un jour ind&egrave;cis persiste</i>,<br />
<i>Et le cr&egrave;puscule triste</i><br />
<i>Ouvre ses yeux d&rsquo;am&eacute;thyste</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Mouill&egrave;s</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Night came on ere the singing and reciting ended, a balmy
Southern evening, lit by a thousand fires from tower and
battlement and moat, the old walls glowing red against the violet
sky.</p>
<p>Picture this scene to yourself, reader mine, and you will
understand the enthusiasm of the artists and writers in our
clan.&nbsp; It needed but little imagination then to reconstruct
the past and fancy one&rsquo;s self back in the days when the
&ldquo;Trancavel&rdquo; held this city against the world.</p>
<p>Sleep that night was filled with a strange phantasmagoria of
crenelated ch&acirc;teaux and armored knights, until the bright
Proven&ccedil;al sunlight and the call for a hurried departure
dispelled such illusions.&nbsp; By noon we were far away from
Carcassonne, mounting the rocky slopes of the Cevennes amid a
wild and noble landscape; the towering cliffs of the
&ldquo;Causses,&rdquo; zebraed by zig-zag paths, lay below us,
disclosing glimpses of fertile valley and vine-engarlanded
plain.</p>
<p>One asks one&rsquo;s self in wonder why these enchanting
regions are so unknown.&nbsp; <i>En route</i> our companions were
like children fresh from school, taking haphazard meals at the
local inns and clambering gayly into any conveyance that came to
hand.&nbsp; As our way led us through the Cevennes country,
another charm gradually stole over the senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine that Citheron must look like this,&rdquo;
murmured Catulle Mend&egrave;s, as we stood looking down from a
sun-baked eminence, &ldquo;with the Gulf of Corinth there where
you see that gleam of water.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he spoke he began
declaiming the passage from Sophocles&rsquo;s <i>&OElig;dipus the
King</i> descriptive if that classic scene.</p>
<p>Two thousand feet below lay Ispanhac in a verdant valley, the
River Tarn gleaming amid the cultivated fields like a cimeter
thrown on a Turkish carpet.&nbsp; Our descent was an avalanche of
laughing, singing &ldquo;Cadets,&rdquo; who rolled in the
fresh-cut grass and chased each other through the ripening
vineyards, shouting lines from tragedies to groups of
open-mouthed farm-hands, and invading the tiny inns on the road
with song and tumult.&nbsp; As we neared our goal its entire
population, headed by the cur&eacute;, came out to meet us and
offer the hospitality of the town.</p>
<p>In the market-place, one of our number, inspired by the
antique solemnity of the surroundings, burst into the noble lines
of Hugo&rsquo;s <i>Devant Dieu</i>, before which the awestruck
population uncovered and crossed themselves, imagining,
doubtless, that it was a religious ceremony.</p>
<p>Another scene recurs vividly to my memory.&nbsp; We were at
St. Enimie.&nbsp; I had opened my window to breathe the night air
after the heat and dust of the day and watch the moonlight on the
quaint bridge at my feet.&nbsp; Suddenly from out the shadows
there rose (like sounds in a dream) the exquisite tone of
Sylvain&rsquo;s voice, alternating with the baritone of
d&rsquo;Esparbes.&nbsp; They were seated at the water&rsquo;s
edge, intoxicated by the beauty of the scene and apparently
oblivious of all else.</p>
<p>The next day was passed on the Tarn, our ten little boats
following each other single file on the narrow river, winding
around the feet of mighty cliffs, or wandering out into sunny
pasture lands where solitary peasants, interrupted in their
labors, listened in astonishment to the chorus thundered from the
passing boats, and waved us a welcome as we moved by.</p>
<p>Space is lacking to give more than a suggestion of those days,
passed in every known conveyance from the antique diligence to
the hissing trolley, in company with men who seemed to have left
their cares and their years behind them in Paris.</p>
<p>Our last stop before arriving at B&eacute;ziers was at La
Case, where luncheon was served in the great hall of the
ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp; Armand Sylvestre presided at the repast; his
verses alternated with the singings of Emma Calv&eacute;, who had
come from her neighboring ch&acirc;teau to greet her old friends
and compatriots, the &ldquo;Cadets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the meal terminated, more than one among the guests, I
imagine, felt his heart heavy with the idea that to-morrow would
end this pleasant ramble and send him back to the realities of
life and the drudgery of daily bread-winning.</p>
<p>The morning of the great day dawned cloudless and cool.&nbsp;
A laughing, many-colored throng early invaded the arena, the
women&rsquo;s gay toilets lending it some resemblance to a
parterre of fantastic flowers.&nbsp; Before the bell sounded its
three strokes that announced the representation, over ten
thousand spectators had taken their places and were studying the
gigantic stage and its four thousand yards of painted
canvas.&nbsp; In the foreground a cluster of Greek palaces and
temples surround a market-place; higher up and further back the
city walls, manned by costumed sentinels, rise against mountains
so happily painted that their outlines blend with nature&rsquo;s
own handiwork in the distance,&mdash;a worthy setting for a
stately drama and the valiant company of actors who have
travelled from the capital for this solemnity.</p>
<p>Three hundred hidden musicians, divided into wind and chord
orchestras, accompany a chorus of two hundred executants, and
furnish the music for a ballet of seventy dancers.</p>
<p>As the third stroke dies away, the Muse, Mademoiselle
Rabuteau, enters and declaims the salutation addressed by Louis
Gallet to the City of B&eacute;ziers.&nbsp; At its conclusion the
tragedy begins.</p>
<p>This is not the place to describe or criticise at length so
new an attempt at classic restoration.&nbsp; The author follows
the admirable fable of antiquity with a directness and simplicity
worthy of his Greek model.&nbsp; The story of Dejanira and
Hercules is too familiar to be repeated here.&nbsp; The
hero&rsquo;s infidelity and the passion of a neglected woman are
related through five acts logically and forcibly, with the noble
music of Saint-Sa&euml;ns as a background.</p>
<p>We watch the growing affection of the demi-god for the gentle
Iole.&nbsp; We sympathize with jealous, desperate Dejanira when
in a last attempt to gain back the love of Hercules she persuades
the unsuspecting Iole to offer him a tunic steeped in
Nessus&rsquo;s blood, which Dejanira has been told by Centaur
will when warmed in the sun restore the wearer to her arms.</p>
<p>At the opening of the fifth act we witness the nuptial
f&ecirc;tes.&nbsp; Religious dances and processions circle around
the pyre laid for a marriage sacrifice.&nbsp; Dejanira, hidden in
the throng, watches in an agony of hope for the miracle to be
worked.</p>
<p>Hercules accepts the fatal garment from the hands of his bride
and calls upon the sun-god to ignite the altars.&nbsp; The pyre
flames, the heat warms the clinging tunic, which wraps Hercules
in its folds of torture.&nbsp; Writhing in agony, he flings
himself upon the burning pyramid, followed by Dejanira, who, in
despair, sees too late that she has been but a tool in the hands
of Nessus.</p>
<p>No feeble prose, no characters of black or white, can do
justice to the closing scenes of this performance.&nbsp; The roar
of the chorus, the thunder of the actors&rsquo; voices, the
impression of reality left on the breathless spectators by the
open-air reality of the scene, the ardent sun, the rustling wind,
the play of light and shade across the stage, the invocation of
Hercules addressed to the real heavens, not to a painted
firmament, combined an effect that few among that vast concourse
will forget.</p>
<p>At the farewell banquet in the arena after the performance,
Georges Leygues, the captain of the Cadets, in answer to a speech
from the Prefect, replied: &ldquo;You ask about our aims and
purposes and speak in admiration of the enthusiasm aroused by the
passage of our band!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our aims are to vivify the traditions and language of
our native land, and the memory of a glorious ancestry, to foster
the love of our little province at the same time as patriotism
for the greater country.&nbsp; We are striving for a
decentralization of art, for the elevation of the stage; but
above all, we preach a gospel of gayety and healthy laughter, the
science of remaining young at heart, would teach pluck and good
humor in the weary struggle of existence, characteristics that
have marked our countrymen through history!&nbsp; We have
borrowed a motto from Lope de Vega (that Gascon of another race),
and inscribe &lsquo;<i>Par la langua et par
l&rsquo;&egrave;p&eacute;e</i>&rsquo; upon our banner, that these
purposes may be read by the world as it runs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 30&mdash;The Dinner and the Drama</h2>
<p>Claude Frollo, holding the first printed book he had seen in
one hand, and pointing with the other to the gigantic mass of
Notre Dame, dark against the sunset, prophesied &ldquo;<i>Ceci
tuera cela</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One might to-day paraphrase the
sentence which Victor Hugo put into his archdeacon&rsquo;s mouth,
and pointing to the elaborately appointed dinner-tables of our
generation, assert that the Dinner was killing the Drama.</p>
<p>New York undoubtedly possesses at this moment more and better
constructed theatres, in proportion to its population, than any
other city on the globe, and, with the single exception of Paris,
more money is probably spent at the theatre by our people than in
any other metropolis.&nbsp; Yet curiously enough, each decade,
each season widens the breach between our discriminating public
and the stage.&nbsp; The theatre, instead of keeping abreast with
the intellectual movement of our country, has for the last thirty
years been slowly but steadily declining, until at this moment
there is hardly a company playing in legitimate comedy, tragedy,
or the classic masterpieces of our language.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that we are a nation in full literary
production, boasting authors who rank with the greatest of other
countries, there is hardly one poet or prose-writer to-day, of
recognized ability, who works for the stage, nor can we count
more than one or two high-class comedies or lyric dramas of
American origin.</p>
<p>It is not my intention here to criticise the contemporary
stage, although the condition of the drama in America is so
unique and so different from its situation in other countries
that it might well attract the attention of inquiring minds; but
rather to glance at the social causes which have produced this
curious state of affairs, and the strained relations existing
between our &eacute;lite (here the word is used in its widest and
most elevated sense) and our stage.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the deterioration in the class
of plays produced at our theatres has been brought about by
changes in our social conditions.&nbsp; The pernicious
&ldquo;star&rdquo; system, the difficulty of keeping stock
companies together, the rarity of histrionic ability among
Americans are explanations which have at different times been
offered to account for these phenomena.&nbsp; Foremost, however,
among the causes should be placed an exceedingly simple and
prosaic fact which seems to have escaped notice.&nbsp; I refer to
the displacement of the dinner hour, and the ceremony now
surrounding that meal.</p>
<p>Forty years ago dinner was still a simple affair, taken at
hours varying from three to five o&rsquo;clock, and uniting few
but the members of a family, holidays and f&ecirc;tes being the
rare occasions when guests were asked.&nbsp; There was probably
not a hotel in this country at that time where a dinner was
served later than three o&rsquo;clock, and Delmonico&rsquo;s,
newly installed in Mr. Moses Grinnell&rsquo;s house, corner of
Fourteenth Street and Fifth Avenue, was the only establishment of
its kind in America, and the one restaurant in New York where
ladies could be taken to dine.&nbsp; In those tranquil days when
dinner parties were few and dances a rarity, theatre-going was
the one ripple on the quiet stream of home life.&nbsp;
Wallack&rsquo;s, at the corner of Thirteenth Street and Broadway,
Booth&rsquo;s in Twenty-third Street, and Fechter&rsquo;s in
Fourteenth Street were the homes of good comedy and high-class
tragedy.</p>
<p>Along about 1870 the more aristocratically-minded New Yorkers
took to dining at six or six-thirty o&rsquo;clock; since then
each decade has seen the dinner recede further into the night,
until it is a common occurrence now to sit down to that repast at
eight or even nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Not only has the hour
changed, but the meal itself has undergone a radical
transformation, in keeping with the general increase of luxurious
living, becoming a serious although hurried function.&nbsp; In
consequence, to go to the theatre and be present at the rising of
the curtain means, for the majority possessing sufficient means
to go often to the play and culture enough to be discriminating,
the disarrangement of the entire machinery of a household as well
as the habits of its inmates.</p>
<p>In addition to this, dozens of sumptuous establishments have
sprung up where the pleasure of eating is supplemented by
allurements to the eye and ear.&nbsp; Fine orchestras play
nightly, the air is laden with the perfume of flowers, a scenic
perspective of palm garden and marble corridor flatters the
senses.&nbsp; The temptation, to a man wearied by a day of
business or sport, to abandon the idea of going to a theatre, and
linger instead over his cigar amid these attractive surroundings,
is almost irresistible.</p>
<p>If, however, tempted by some success, he hurries his guests
away from their meal, they are in no condition to appreciate a
serious performance.&nbsp; The pressure has been too high all day
for the overworked man and his <i>&eacute;nerv&eacute;e</i> wife
to desire any but the lightest tomfoolery in an
entertainment.&nbsp; People engaged in the lethargic process of
digestion are not good critics of either elevated poetry or
delicate interpretation, and in consequence crave amusement
rather than a mental stimulant.</p>
<p>Managers were quick to perceive that their productions were no
longer taken seriously, and that it was a waste of time and money
to offer high-class entertainments to audiences whom any nonsense
would attract.&nbsp; When a play like <i>The Swell Miss
Fitzwell</i> will pack a New York house for months, and then
float a company on the high tide of success across the continent,
it would be folly to produce anything better.&nbsp; New York
influences the taste of the country; it is in New York really
that the standard has been lowered.</p>
<p>In answer to these remarks, the question will doubtless be
raised, &ldquo;Are not the influences which it is asserted are
killing the drama in America at work in England or on the
Continent, where people also dine late and well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, and no!&nbsp; People abroad dine as well, undoubtedly; as
elaborately?&nbsp; Certainly not!&nbsp; With the exception of the
English (and even among them dinner-giving has never become so
universal as with us), no other people entertain for the pleasure
of hospitality.&nbsp; On the Continent, a dinner-party is always
an &ldquo;axe-grinding&rdquo; function.&nbsp; A family who asked
people to dine without having a distinct end in view for such an
outlay would be looked upon by their friends and relatives as
little short of lunatics.&nbsp; Diplomatists are allowed certain
sums by their governments for entertaining, and are formally
dined in return by their guests.&nbsp; A great French lady who is
asked to dine out twice a week considers herself fortunate; a New
York woman of equal position hardly dines at home from December 1
to April 15, unless she is receiving friends at her own
table.</p>
<p>Parisian ladies rarely go to restaurants.&nbsp; In London
there are not more than three or four places where ladies can be
taken to dine, while in this city there are hundreds; our people
have caught the habit of dining away from home, a custom
singularly in keeping with the American temperament; for,
although it costs more, it is less trouble!</p>
<p>The reason why foreigners do not entertain at dinner is
because they have found other and more satisfactory ways of
spending their money.&nbsp; This leaves people abroad with a
number of evenings on their hands, unoccupied hours that are
generally passed at the theatre.&nbsp; Only the other day a
diplomatist said to me, &ldquo;I am surprised to see how small a
place the theatre occupies in your thoughts and
conversation.&nbsp; With us it is the pivot around which life
revolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From one cause or another, not only the wealthy, but the
thoughtful and cultivated among us, go less each year to the
theatre.&nbsp; The abstinence of this class is the most
significant, for well-read, refined, fastidious citizens are the
pride of a community, and their influence for good is
far-reaching.&nbsp; Of this &eacute;lite New York has more than
its share, but you will not meet them at the play, unless Duse or
Jefferson, Bernhardt or Coquelin is performing.&nbsp; The best
only tempts such minds.&nbsp; It was by the encouragement of this
class that Booth was enabled to give <i>Hamlet</i> one hundred
consecutive evenings, and Fechter was induced to linger here and
build a theatre.</p>
<p>In comparison with the verdicts of such people, the opinions
of fashionable sets are of little importance.&nbsp; The latter
long ago gave up going to the play in New York, except during two
short seasons, one in the autumn, &ldquo;before things get
going,&rdquo; and again in the spring, after the season is over,
before they flit abroad or to the country.&nbsp; During these
periods &ldquo;smart&rdquo; people generally attend in bands
called &ldquo;theatre parties,&rdquo; an infliction unknown
outside of this country, an arrangement above all others
calculated to bring the stage into contempt, as such parties
seldom arrive before the middle of the second act, take ten
minutes to get seated, and then chat gayly among themselves for
the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>The theatre, having ceased to form an integral part of our
social life, has come to be the pastime of people with nothing
better to do,&mdash;the floating population of our hotels, the
shop-girl and her young man enjoying an evening out.&nbsp; The
plays produced by the gentlemen who, I am told, control the stage
in this country for the moment, are adapted to the requirements
of an audience that, having no particular standard from which to
judge the literary merits of a play, the training, accent, or
talent of the actors, are perfectly contented so long as they are
amused.&nbsp; To get a laugh, at any price, has become the
ambition of most actors and the dream of managers.</p>
<p>A young actress in a company that played an American
translation of <i>Mme. Sans G&ecirc;ne</i> all over this
continent asked me recently what I thought of their
performance.&nbsp; I said I thought it &ldquo;a burlesque of the
original!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you thought it a burlesque here
in town,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s well you
didn&rsquo;t see us on the road.&nbsp; There was no monkey trick
we would not play to raise a laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If one of my readers doubts the assertion that the better
classes have ceased to attend our theatres, except on rare
occasions, let him inquire about, among the men and women whose
opinions he values and respects, how many of last winter&rsquo;s
plays they considered intellectual treats, or what piece tempted
them to leave their cosy dinner-tables a second time.&nbsp; It is
surprising to find the number who will answer in reply to a
question about the merits of a play <i>en vogue</i>, &ldquo;I
have not seen it.&nbsp; In fact I rarely go to a theatre unless I
am in London or on the Continent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little by little we have taken to turning in a vicious and
ever-narrowing circle.&nbsp; The poorer the plays, the less
clever people will make the effort necessary to see them, and the
less such &eacute;lite attend, the poorer the plays will
become.</p>
<p>That this state of affairs is going to last, however, I do not
believe.&nbsp; The darkest hour is ever the last before the
dawn.&nbsp; As it would he difficult for the performances in most
of our theatres to fall any lower in the scale of frivolity or
inanity, we may hope for a reaction that will be deep and
far-reaching.&nbsp; At present we are like people dying of
starvation because they do not know how to combine the flour and
water and yeast before them into wholesome bread.&nbsp; The
materials for a brilliant and distinctly national stage
undoubtedly exist in this country.&nbsp; We have men and women
who would soon develop into great actors if they received any
encouragement to devote themselves to a higher class of work, and
certainly our great city does not possess fewer appreciative
people than it did twenty years ago.</p>
<p>The great dinner-giving mania will eat itself out; and
managers, feeling once more that they can count on discriminating
audiences, will no longer dare to give garbled versions of French
farces or feeble dramas as compiled from English novels, but,
turning to our own poets and writers, will ask them to contribute
towards the formation of an American stage literature.</p>
<p>When, finally, one of our poets gives us a lyric drama like
<i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, the attractions of the dinner-table
will no longer be strong enough to keep clever people away from
the theatre, and the following conversation, which sums up the
present situation, will become impossible.</p>
<p><i>Banker</i> (to Crushed Tragedian).&mdash;No, I
haven&rsquo;t seen you act.&nbsp; I have not been inside a
theatre for two years!</p>
<p><i>C.T.</i>&mdash;It&rsquo;s five years since I&rsquo;ve been
inside a bank!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 31&mdash;The Modern <i>Aspasia</i></h2>
<p>Most of the historic cities of Europe have a distinct local
color, a temperament, if one may be allowed the expression, of
their own.&nbsp; The austere calm of Bruges or Ghent, the
sensuous beauty of Naples, attract different natures.&nbsp;
Florence has passionate devotees, who are insensible to the
artistic grace of Venice or the stately quiet of
Versailles.&nbsp; In Cairo one experiences an exquisite <i>bien
&ecirc;tre</i>, a mindless, ambitionless contentment which,
without being languor, soothes the nerves and tempts to indolent
lotus-eating.&nbsp; Like a great hive, Rome depends on the
memories that circle around her, storing, like bees, the
centuries with their honey.&nbsp; Each of these cities must
therefore leave many people unmoved, who after a passing visit,
wander away, wondering at the enthusiasm of the worshippers.</p>
<p>Paris alone seems to possess the charm that bewitches all
conditions, all ages, all degrees.&nbsp; To hold the
frivolous-minded she paints her face and dances, leading them a
round of folly, exhaustive alike to health and purse.&nbsp; For
the student she assumes another mien, smiling encouragement, and
urging him upward towards the highest standards, while posing as
his model.&nbsp; She takes the dreaming lover of the past gently
by the hand, and leading him into quiet streets and squares where
she has stored away a wealth of hidden treasure, enslaves him as
completely as her more sensual admirers.</p>
<p>Paris is no less adored by the vacant-minded, to whom neither
art nor pleasure nor study appeal.&nbsp; Her caprices in fashion
are received by the wives and daughters of the universe as laws,
and obeyed with an unwavering faith, a mute obedience that few
religions have commanded.&nbsp; Women who yawn through Italy and
the East have, when one meets them in the French capital, the
intense manner, the air of separation from things mundane, that
is observable in pilgrims approaching the shrine of their
deity.&nbsp; Mohammedans at Mecca must have some such look.&nbsp;
In Paris women find themselves in the presence of those high
priests whom they have long worshipped from a distance.&nbsp; It
is useless to mention other subjects to the devotee, for they
will not fix her attention.&nbsp; Her thoughts are with her
heart, and that is far away.</p>
<p>When visiting other cities one feels that they are like honest
married women, living quiet family lives, surrounded by their
children.&nbsp; The French Aspasia, on the contrary, has never
been true to any vow, but has, at the dictate of her passions,
changed from royal and imperial to republican lovers, and back
again, ruled by no laws but her caprices, and discarding each
favorite in turn with insults when she has wearied of him.&nbsp;
Yet sovereigns are her slaves, and leave their lands to linger in
her presence; and rich strangers from the four corners of the
earth come to throw their fortunes at her feet and bask a moment
in her smiles.</p>
<p>Like her classic prototype, Paris is also the companion of the
philosophers and leads the arts in her train.&nbsp; Her palaces
are the meeting-places of the poets, the sculptors, the
dramatists, and the painters, who are never weary of celebrating
her perfections, nor of working for her adornment and
amusement.</p>
<p>Those who live in the circle of her influence are caught up in
a whirlwind of artistic production, and consume their brains and
bodies in the vain hope of pleasing their idol and attracting her
attention.&nbsp; To be loved by Paris is an ordeal that few
natures can stand, for she wrings the lifeblood from her devotees
and then casts them aside into oblivion.&nbsp; Paris, said one of
her greatest writers, &ldquo;<i>aime &agrave; briser ses
idoles</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; As Ulysses and his companions fell, in
other days, a prey to the allurements of Circe, so our powerful
young nation has fallen more than any other under the influence
of the French siren, and brings her a yearly tribute of gold
which she receives with avidity, although in her heart there is
little fondness for the giver.</p>
<p>Americans who were in Paris two years ago had an excellent
opportunity of judging the sincerity of Parisian affection, and
of sounding the depth and unselfishness of the love that this
fickle city gives us in return for our homage.&nbsp; Not for one
moment did she hesitate, but threw the whole weight of her
influence and wit into the scale for Spain.&nbsp; If there is not
at this moment a European alliance against America it is not from
any lack of effort on her part towards that end.</p>
<p>The stand taken by <i>la villa lumi&egrave;re</i> in that
crisis caused many na&iuml;ve Americans, who believed that their
weakness for the French capital was returned, a painful
surprise.&nbsp; They imagined in the simplicity of their innocent
hearts that she loved them for themselves, and have awakened,
like other rich lovers, to the humiliating knowledge that a
penniless neighbor was receiving the caresses that Croesus paid
for.&nbsp; Not only did the entire Parisian press teem at that
moment with covert insults directed towards us, but in society,
at the clubs and tables of the aristocracy, it was impossible for
an American to appear with self-respect, so persistently were our
actions and our reasons for undertaking that war misunderstood
and misrepresented.&nbsp; In the conversation of the salons and
in the daily papers it was assumed that the Spanish were a race
of noble patriots, fighting in the defence of a loved and loyal
colony, while we were a horde of blatant cowards, who had long
fermented a revolution in Cuba in order to appropriate that
coveted island.</p>
<p>When the Spanish authorities allowed an American ship
(surprised in one of her ports by the declaration of war) to
depart unharmed, the fact was magnified into an act of almost
ideal generosity; on the other hand, when we decided not to
permit privateering, that announcement was received with derisive
laughter as a pretentious pose to cover hidden interests.&nbsp;
There is reason to believe, however, that this feeling in favor
of Spain goes little further than the press and the aristocratic
circles so dear to the American &ldquo;climber&rdquo;; the real
heart of the French nation is as true to us as when a century ago
she spent blood and treasure in our cause.&nbsp; It is the
inconstant capital alone that, false to her r&ocirc;le of
liberator, has sided with the tyrant.</p>
<p>Yet when I wander through her shady parks or lean over her
monumental quays, drinking in the beauty of the first spring
days, intoxicated by the perfume of the flowers that the night
showers have kissed into bloom; or linger of an evening over my
coffee, with the brilliant life of the boulevards passing like a
carnival procession before my eyes; when I sit in her theatres,
enthralled by the genius of her actors and playwrights, or stand
bewildered before the ten thousand paintings and statues of the
Salon, I feel inclined, like a betrayed lover, to pardon my
faithless mistress: she is too lovely to remain long angry with
her.&nbsp; You realize she is false and will betray you again,
laughing at you, insulting your weakness; but when she smiles all
faults are forgotten; the ardor of her kisses blinds you to her
inconstancy; she pours out a draught that no other hands can
brew, and clasps you in arms so fair that life outside those
fragile barriers seems stale and unprofitable.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 32&mdash;A Nation in a Hurry</h2>
<p>In early days of steam navigation on the Mississippi, the
river captains, it is said, had the playful habit, when pressed
for time or enjoying a &ldquo;spurt&rdquo; with a rival, of
running their engines with a darky seated on the
safety-valve.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s first home impression after a season of lazy
Continental travelling and visiting in somnolent English country
houses, is that an emblematical Ethiopian should be quartered on
our national arms.</p>
<p>Zola tells us in <i>Nouvelle Campagne</i> that his vivid
impressions are all received during the first twenty-four hours
in a new surrounding,&mdash;the mind, like a photographic film,
quickly losing its sensibility.</p>
<p>This fleeting receptiveness makes returning Americans
painfully conscious of nerves in the home atmosphere, and the
headlong pace at which our compatriots are living.</p>
<p>The habit of laying such faults to the climate is but a poor
excuse.&nbsp; Our grandparents and their parents lived peaceful
lives beneath these same skies, undisturbed by the morbid
influences that are supposed to key us to such a painful concert
pitch.</p>
<p>There was an Indian summer languor in the air as we steamed up
the bay last October, that apparently invited repose; yet no
sooner had we set foot on our native dock, and taken one good
whiff of home air, than all our acquired calm disappeared.&nbsp;
People who ten days before would have sat (at a journey&rsquo;s
end) contentedly in a waiting-room, while their luggage was being
sorted by leisurely officials, now hustle nervously about,
nagging the custom-house officers and egging on the porters, as
though the saving of the next half hour were the prime object of
existence.</p>
<p>Considering how extravagant we Americans are in other ways it
seems curious that we should be so economical of time!&nbsp; It
was useless to struggle against the current, however, or to
attempt to hold one&rsquo;s self back.&nbsp; Before ten minutes
on shore had passed, the old, familiar, unpleasant sensation of
being in a hurry took possession of me!&nbsp; It was irresistible
and all-pervading; from the movements of the crowds in the
streets to the whistle of the harbor tugs, everything breathed of
haste.&nbsp; The very dogs had apparently no time to loiter, but
scurried about as though late for their engagements.</p>
<p>The transit from dock to hotel was like a visit to a new
circle in the <i>Inferno</i>, where trains rumble eternally
overhead, and cable cars glide and block around a pale-faced
throng of the damned, who are forced, in expiation of their sins,
to hasten forever toward an unreachable goal.</p>
<p>A curious curse has fallen upon our people; an
&ldquo;influence&rdquo; is at work which forces us to attempt in
an hour just twice as much as can be accomplished in sixty
minutes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do as well as you can,&rdquo; whispers the
&ldquo;influence,&rdquo; &ldquo;but do it quickly!&rdquo;&nbsp;
That motto might be engraved upon the fronts of our homes and
business buildings.</p>
<p>It is on account of this new standard that rapidity in a
transaction on the Street is appreciated more than correctness of
detail.&nbsp; A broker to-day will take more credit for having
received and executed an order for Chicago and returned an answer
within six minutes, than for any amount of careful work.&nbsp;
The order may have been ill executed and the details mixed, but
there will have been celerity of execution to boast of</p>
<p>The young man who expects to succeed in business to-day must
be a &ldquo;hustler,&rdquo; have a snap-shot style in
conversation, patronize rapid transit vehicles, understand
shorthand, and eat at &ldquo;breathless breakfasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being taken recently to one of these establishments for
&ldquo;quick lunch,&rdquo; as I believe the correct phrase is, to
eat buckwheat cakes (and very good they were), I had an
opportunity of studying the ways of the modern time-saving young
man.</p>
<p>It is his habit upon entering to dash for the bill-of-fare,
and give an order (if he is adroit enough to catch one of the
maids on the fly) before removing either coat or hat.&nbsp; At
least fifteen seconds may be economized in this way.&nbsp; Once
seated, the luncher falls to on anything at hand; bread, cold
slaw, crackers, or catsup.&nbsp; When the dish ordered arrives,
he gets his fork into it as it appears over his shoulder, and has
cleaned the plate before the sauce makes its appearance, so that
is eaten by itself or with bread.</p>
<p>Cups of coffee or tea go down in two swallows.&nbsp; Little
piles of cakes are cut in quarters and disappear in four
mouthfuls, much after the fashion of children down the
ogre&rsquo;s throat in the mechanical toy, mastication being
either a lost art or considered a foolish waste of energy.</p>
<p>A really accomplished luncher can assimilate his last quarter
of cakes, wiggle into his coat, and pay his check at the desk at
the same moment.&nbsp; The next, he is down the block in pursuit
of a receding trolley.</p>
<p>To any one fresh from the Continent, where the entire
machinery of trade comes to a standstill from eleven to one
o&rsquo;clock, that <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> may be taken in
somnolent tranquillity, the nervous tension pervading a
restaurant here is prodigious, and what is
worse&mdash;catching!&nbsp; During recent visits to the business
centres of our city, I find that the idea of eating is
repugnant.&nbsp; It seems to be wrong to waste time on anything
so unproductive.&nbsp; Last week a friend offered me a
&ldquo;luncheon tablet&rdquo; from a box on his desk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as a meal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
so much more expeditious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proprietor of one down-town restaurant has the stock
quotations exhibited on a black-board at the end of his room; in
this way his patrons can keep in touch with the
&ldquo;Street&rdquo; as they hurriedly stoke up.</p>
<p>A parlor car, toward a journey&rsquo;s end, is another
excellent place to observe our native ways.&nbsp; Coming from
Washington the other day my fellow-passengers began to show signs
of restlessness near Newark.&nbsp; Books and papers were thrown
aside; a general &ldquo;uprising, unveiling&rdquo; followed,
accompanied by our objectionable custom of having our clothes
brushed in each other&rsquo;s faces.&nbsp; By the time Jersey
City appeared on the horizon, every man, woman, and child in that
car was jammed, baggage in hand, into the stuffy little passage
which precedes the entrance, swaying and staggering about while
the train backed and delayed.</p>
<p>The explanation of this is quite simple.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;influence&rdquo; was at work, preventing those people from
acting like other civilized mortals, and remaining seated until
their train had come to a standstill.</p>
<p>Being fresh from the &ldquo;other side,&rdquo; and retaining
some of my acquired calm, I sat in my chair!&nbsp; The surprise
on the faces of the other passengers warned me, however, that it
would not be safe to carry this pose too far.&nbsp; The porter,
puzzled by the unaccustomed sight, touched me kindly on the
shoulder, and asked if I &ldquo;felt sick&rdquo;!&nbsp; So now,
to avoid all affectation of superiority, I struggled into my
great-coat, regardless of eighty degrees temperature in the car,
and meekly joined the standing army of martyrs, to hurry,
scampering with them from the still-moving car to the boat, and
on to the trolley before the craft had been moored to its landing
pier.</p>
<p>In Paris, on taking an omnibus, you are given a number and the
right to the first vacant seat.&nbsp; When the places in a
&ldquo;bus&rdquo; are all occupied it receives no further
occupants.&nbsp; Imagine a traction line attempting such a reform
here!&nbsp; There would be a riot, and the conductors hanged to
the nearest trolley-poles in an hour!</p>
<p>To prevent a citizen from crowding into an over-full vehicle,
and stamping on its occupants in the process, would be to
infringe one of his dearest privileges, not to mention his chance
of riding free.</p>
<p>A small boy of my acquaintance tells me he rarely finds it
necessary to pay in a New York car.&nbsp; The conductors are too
hurried and too preoccupied pocketing their share of the receipts
to keep count.&nbsp; &ldquo;When he passes, I just look
blank!&rdquo; remarked the ingenious youth.</p>
<p>Of all the individuals, however, in the community, our idle
class suffer the most acutely from lack of time, though, like
Charles Lamb&rsquo;s gentleman, they have all there is.</p>
<p>From the moment a man of leisure, or his wife, wakens in the
morning until they drop into a fitful slumber at night, their day
is an agitated chase.&nbsp; No matter where or when you meet
them, they are always on the wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I late again?&rdquo; gasped a thin little woman to
me the other evening, as she hurried into the drawing-room, where
she had kept her guests and dinner waiting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so driven all day, I&rsquo;m a
wreck!&rdquo;&nbsp; A glance at her hatchet-faced husband
revealed the fact that he, too, was chasing after a stray
half-hour lost somewhere in his youth.&nbsp; His color and most
of his hair had gone in its pursuit, while his hands had acquired
a twitch, as though urging on a tired steed.</p>
<p>Go and ask that lady for a cup of tea at twilight; ten to one
she will receive you with her hat on, explaining that she has not
had time to take it off since breakfast.&nbsp; If she writes to
you, her notes are signed, &ldquo;In great haste,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;In a tearing hurry.&rdquo;&nbsp; She is out of her house
by half-past eight on most mornings, yet when calling she sits on
the edge of her chair, and assures you that she has not a moment
to stay, &ldquo;has only run in,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>Just what drives her so hard is a mystery, for beyond a vague
charity meeting or two and some calls, she accomplishes
little.&nbsp; Although wealthy and childless, with no cares and
few worries, she succumbs to nervous prostration every two or
three years, &ldquo;from overwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listen to a compatriot&rsquo;s account of his European
trip!&nbsp; He will certainly tell you how short the ocean
crossing was, giving hours and minutes with zest, as though he
had got ahead of Father Time in a transaction.&nbsp; Then follows
a list of the many countries seen during his tour.</p>
<p>I know a lady lying ill to-day because she would hurry herself
and her children, in six weeks last summer, through a Continental
tour that should have occupied three months.&nbsp; She had no
particular reason for hurrying; indeed, she got ahead of her
schedule, and had to wait in Paris for the steamer; a detail,
however, that in no way diminished madame&rsquo;s pleasure in
having done so much during her holiday.&nbsp; This same lady
deplores lack of leisure hours, yet if she finds by her
engagement book that there is a free week ahead, she will run to
Washington or Lakewood, &ldquo;for a change,&rdquo; or organize a
party to Florida.</p>
<p>To realize how our upper ten scramble through existence, one
must also contrast their fidgety way of feeding with the bovine
calm in which a German absorbs his nourishment and the hours
Italians can pass over their meals; an American dinner party
affords us the opportunity.</p>
<p>There is an impression that the fashion for quickly served
dinners came to us from England.&nbsp; If this is true (which I
doubt; it fits too nicely with our temperament to have been
imported), we owe H.R.H. a debt of gratitude, for nothing is so
tiresome as too many courses needlessly prolonged.</p>
<p>Like all converts, however, we are too zealous.&nbsp; From
oysters to fruit, dinners now are a breathless steeplechase,
during which we take our viand hedges and champagne ditches at a
dead run, with conversation pushed at much the same speed.&nbsp;
To be silent would be to imply that one was not having a good
time, so we rattle and gobble on toward the finger-bowl
winning-post, only to find that rest is not there!</p>
<p>As the hostess pilots the ladies away to the drawing-room, she
whispers to her spouse, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t smoke long, will
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; So we are mulcted in the enjoyment of even that
last resource of weary humanity, the cigar, and are hustled away
from that and our coffee, only to find that our appearance is a
signal for a general move.</p>
<p>One of the older ladies rises; the next moment the whole
circle, like a flock of frightened birds, are up and off,
crowding each other in the hallway, calling for their carriages,
and confusing the unfortunate servants, who are trying to help
them into their cloaks and overshoes.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the guests come as late as they dare,
without being absolutely uncivil, that dinners are served as
rapidly as is physically possible, and that the circle breaks up
as soon as the meal ends, one asks one&rsquo;s self in wonder
why, if a dinner party is such a bore that it has to be scrambled
through, <i>co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te</i>, we continue to dine
out?</p>
<p>It is within the bounds of possibility that people may have
reasons for hurrying through their days, and that dining out
<i>&agrave; la longue</i> becomes a weariness.</p>
<p>The one place, however, where you might expect to find people
reposeful and calm is at the theatre.&nbsp; The labor of the day
is then over; they have assembled for an hour or two of
relaxation and amusement.&nbsp; Yet it is at the play that our
restlessness is most apparent.&nbsp; Watch an audience (which, be
it remarked in passing, has arrived late) during the last ten
minutes of a performance.&nbsp; No sooner do they discover that
the end is drawing near than people begin to struggle into their
wraps.&nbsp; By the time the players have lined up before the
footlights the house is full of disappearing backs.</p>
<p>Past, indeed, are the unruffled days when a heroine was
expected (after the action of a play had ended) to deliver the
closing <i>envoi</i> dear to the writers of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
day.&nbsp; Thackeray writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The play is done</i>!&nbsp; <i>The curtain
drops</i>,<br />
<i>Slow falling to the prompter&rsquo;s bell</i>!<br />
<i>A moment yet the actor stops</i>,<br />
<i>And looks around</i>, <i>to say farewell</i>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A comedian who attempted any such abuse of the situation
to-day would find himself addressing empty benches.&nbsp; Before
he had finished the first line of his epilogue, most of his
public would be housed in the rapid transit cars.&nbsp; No
talent, no novelty holds our audiences to the end of a
performance.</p>
<p>On the opening night of the opera season this winter, one
third of the &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; and orchestra stalls were vacant
before Romeo (who, being a foreigner, was taking his time) had
expired.</p>
<p>One overworked matron of my acquaintance has perfected an
ingenious and time-saving combination.&nbsp; By signalling from a
window near her opera box to a footman below, she is able to get
her carriage at least two minutes sooner than her neighbors.</p>
<p>During the last act of an opera like <i>Tann-h&auml;user</i>
or <i>Faust</i>, in which the inconsiderate composer has placed a
musical gem at the end, this lady is worth watching.&nbsp; After
getting into her wraps and overshoes she stands, hand on the
door, at the back of her box, listening to the singers; at a
certain moment she hurries to the window, makes her signal,
scurries back, hears Calv&eacute; pour her soul out in <i>Anges
purs</i>, <i>anges radieux</i>, yet manages to get down the
stairs and into her carriage before the curtain has fallen.</p>
<p>We deplore the prevailing habit of &ldquo;slouch&rdquo;; yet
if you think of it, this universal hurry is the cause of
it.&nbsp; Our cities are left unsightly, because we cannot spare
time to beautify them.&nbsp; Nervous diseases are distressingly
prevalent; still we hurry! hurry!! hurry!!! until, as a
diplomatist recently remarked to me, the whole nation seemed to
him to be but five minutes ahead of an apoplectic fit.</p>
<p>The curious part of the matter is that after several weeks at
home, much that was strange at first becomes quite natural to the
traveller, who finds himself thinking with pity of benighted
foreigners and their humdrum ways, and would resent any attempts
at reform.</p>
<p>What, for instance, would replace for enterprising souls the
joy of taking their matutinal car at a flying leap, or the
rapture of being first out of a theatre?&nbsp; What does part of
a last act or the &ldquo;star song&rdquo; matter in comparison
with five minutes of valuable time to the good?&nbsp; Like the
river captains, we propose to run under full head of steam and
get there, or b--- explode!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER 33&mdash;The Spirit of History</h2>
<p>Buildings become tombs when the race that constructed them has
disappeared.&nbsp; Libraries and manuscripts are catacombs where
most of us might wander in the dark forever, finding no
issue.&nbsp; To know dead generations and their environments
through these channels, to feel a love so strong that it calls
the past forth from its winding-sheet, and gives it life again,
as Christ did Lazarus, is the privilege only of great
historians.</p>
<p>France is honoring the memory of such a man at this moment;
one who for forty years sought the vital spark of his
country&rsquo;s existence, striving to resuscitate what he called
&ldquo;the great soul of history,&rdquo; as it developed through
successive acts of the vast drama.&nbsp; This employment of his
genius is Michelet&rsquo;s title to fame.</p>
<p>In a sombre structure, the tall windows of which look across
the Luxembourg trees to the Pantheon, where her husband&rsquo;s
bust has recently been placed, a widow preserves with religious
care the souvenirs of this great historian.&nbsp; Nothing that
can recall either his life or his labor is changed.</p>
<p>Madame Michelet&rsquo;s life is in strange contrast with the
ways of the modern spouse who, under pretext of grief, discards
and displaces every reminder of the dead.&nbsp; In our day, when
the great art is to forget, an existence consecrated to a memory
is so rare that the world might be the better for knowing that a
woman lives who, young and beautiful, was happy in the society of
an old man, whose genius she appreciated and cherished, who loves
him dead as she loved him living.&nbsp; By her care the apartment
remains as it stood when he left it, to die at
Hy&egrave;res,&mdash;the furniture, the paintings, the
writing-table.&nbsp; No stranger has sat in his chair, no
acquaintance has drunk from his cup.&nbsp; This woman, who was a
perfect wife and now fills one&rsquo;s ideal of what a
widow&rsquo;s life should be, has constituted herself the
vigilant guardian of her husband&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; She loves
to talk of the illustrious dead, and tell how he was fond of
saying that Virgil and Vico were his parents.&nbsp; Any one who
reads the <i>Georgics</i> or <i>The Bird</i> will see the truth
of this, for he loved all created things, his ardent spiritism
perceiving that the essence which moved the ocean&rsquo;s tides
was the same that sang in the robin at the window during his last
illness, which he called his &ldquo;little captive
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of <i>La Bible de l&rsquo;Humanit&eacute;</i> had
to a supreme degree the love of country, and possessed the power
of reincarnating with each succeeding cycle of its history.&nbsp;
So luminous was his mind, so profound and far-reaching his
sympathy, that he understood the obscure workings of the
medi&aelig;val mind as clearly as he appreciated Mirabeau&rsquo;s
transcendent genius.&nbsp; He believed that humanity, like
Prometheus, was self-made; that nations modelled their own
destiny during the actions and reactions of history, as each one
of us acquires a personality through the struggles and
temptations of existence, by the evolving power every soul
carries within itself.</p>
<p>Michelet taught that each nation was the hero of its own
drama; that great men have not been different from the rest of
their race&mdash;on the contrary, being the condensation of an
epoch, that, no matter what the apparent eccentricities of a
leader may have been, he was the expression of a people&rsquo;s
spirit.&nbsp; This discovery that a race is transformed by its
action upon itself and upon the elements it absorbs from without,
wipes away at a stroke the popular belief in &ldquo;predestined
races&rdquo; or providential &ldquo;great men&rdquo; appearing at
crucial moments and riding victorious across the world.</p>
<p>An historian, if what he writes is to have any value, must
know the people, the one great historical factor.&nbsp;
Radicalism in history is the beginning of truth.&nbsp; Guided by
this light of his own, Michelet discovered a fresh factor
heretofore unnoticed, that vast fermentation which in France
transforms all foreign elements into an integral part of the
country&rsquo;s being.&nbsp; After studying his own land through
the thirteen centuries of her growth, from the chart of
Childebert to the will of Louis XVI., Michelet declared that
while England is a composite empire and Germany a region, France
is a personality.&nbsp; In consequence he regarded the history of
his country as a long dramatic poem.&nbsp; Here we reach the
inner thought of the historian, the secret impulse that guided
his majestic pen.</p>
<p>The veritable hero of his splendid Iliad is at first ignorant
and obscure, seeking passionately like &OElig;dipus to know
himself.&nbsp; The interest of the piece is absorbing.&nbsp; We
can follow the gradual development of his nature as it becomes
more attractive and sympathetic with each advancing age, until,
through the hundred acts of the tragedy, he achieves a
soul.&nbsp; For Michelet to write the history of his country was
to describe the long evolution of a hero.&nbsp; He was fond of
telling his friends that during the Revolution of July, while he
was making his translation of Vico, this great fact was revealed
to him in the blazing vision of a people in revolt.&nbsp; At that
moment the young and unknown author resolved to devote his life,
his talents, his gift of clairvoyance, the magic of his
inimitable style and creative genius, to fixing on paper the
features seen in his vision.</p>
<p>Conceived and executed in this spirit, his history could be
but a stupendous epic, and proves once again the truth of
Aristotle&rsquo;s assertion that there is often greater truth in
poetry than in prose.</p>
<p>Seeking in the remote past for the origin of his hero,
Michelet pauses first before <i>the Cathedral</i>.&nbsp; The poem
begins like some medi&aelig;val tale.&nbsp; The first years of
his youthful country are devoted to a mystic religion.&nbsp;
Under his ardent hands vast naves rise and belfries touch the
clouds.&nbsp; It is but a sad and cramped development, however;
statutes restrain his young ardor and chill his blood.&nbsp; It
is not until the boy is behind the plough in the fields and
sunlight that his real life begins&mdash;a poor, brutish
existence, if you will, but still life.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Jacques,&rdquo; half man and half beast, of the Middle
Ages is the result of a thousand years of suffering.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s voice calls this brute to arms.&nbsp; An enemy
is overrunning the land.&nbsp; Joan the virgin&mdash;&ldquo;my
Joan,&rdquo; Michelet calls her&mdash;whose heart bleeds when
blood is shed, frees her country.&nbsp; A shadow, however, soon
obscures this gracious vision from Jacques&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
The vast monarchical incubus rises between the people and their
ideal.&nbsp; Our historian turns in disgust from the later French
kings.&nbsp; He has neither time nor heart to write their
history, so passes quickly from Louis XI. to the great climax of
his drama&mdash;the Revolution.&nbsp; There we find his hero,
emerging at last from tyranny and oppression.&nbsp; Freedom and
happiness are before him.&nbsp; Alas! his eyes, accustomed to the
dim light of dungeons, are dazzled by the sun of liberty; he
strikes friend and foe alike.</p>
<p>In the solitary galleries of the &ldquo;Archives&rdquo;
Michelet communes with the great spirits of that day, Desaix,
Marceau, Kleber,&mdash;elder sons of the Republic, who whisper
many secrets to their pupil as he turns over faded pages tied
with tri-colored ribbons, where the cities of France have written
their affection for liberty, love-letters from Jacques to his
mistress.&nbsp; Michelet is happy.&nbsp; His long labor is
drawing to an end.&nbsp; The great epic which he has followed as
it developed through the centuries is complete.&nbsp; His hero
stands hand in hand before the altar with the spouse of his
choice, for whose smile he has toiled and struggled.&nbsp; The
poet-historian sees again in the <i>F&ecirc;te de la
F&eacute;d&eacute;ration</i> the radiant face of his vision, the
true face of France, <i>La Dulce</i>.</p>
<p>Through all the lyricism of this master&rsquo;s work one feels
that he has &ldquo;lived&rdquo; history as he wrote it, following
his subject from its obscure genesis to a radiant
apotheosis.&nbsp; The faithful companion of Michelet&rsquo;s age
has borne witness to this power which he possessed of projecting
himself into another age and living with his subject.&nbsp; She
repeats to those who know her how he trembled in passion and
burned with patriotic emotion in transcribing the crucial pages
of his country&rsquo;s history, rejoicing in her successes and
depressed by her faults, like the classic historian who refused
with horror to tell the story of his compatriots&rsquo; defeat at
Cann&aelig;, saying, &ldquo;I could not survive the
recital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; a friend once asked Madame
Michelet, &ldquo;how, when your husband was writing his chapters
on the Reign of Terror, he ended by falling ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was the
week he executed Danton.&nbsp; We were living in the country near
Nantes.&nbsp; The ground was covered with snow.&nbsp; I can see
him now, hurrying to and fro under the bare trees, gesticulating
and crying as he walked, &lsquo;How can I judge them, those great
men?&nbsp; How can I judge them?&rsquo;&nbsp; It was in this way
that he threw his &lsquo;thousand souls&rsquo; into the past and
lived in sympathy with all men, an apostle of universal
love.&nbsp; After one of these fecund hours he would drop into
his chair and murmur, &lsquo;I am crushed by this work.&nbsp; I
have been writing with my blood!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas, his aged eyes were destined to read sadder pages than he
had ever written, to see years as tragic as the
&ldquo;Terror.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lived to hear the recital of
(having refused to witness) his country&rsquo;s humiliation, and
fell one April morning, in his retirement near Pisa, unconscious
under the double shock of invasion and civil war.&nbsp; Though he
recovered later, his horizon remained dark.&nbsp; The patriot
suffered to see party spirit and warring factions rending the
nation he had so often called the pilot of humanity&rsquo;s bark,
which seemed now to be going straight on the rocks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Finis Galli&aelig;</i>,&rdquo; murmured the historian,
who to the end lived and died with his native land.</p>
<p>Thousands yearly mount the broad steps of the Panth&eacute;on
to lay their wreaths upon his tomb, and thousands more in every
Gallic schoolroom are daily learning, in the pages of his
history, to love <i>France la Dulce</i>.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
